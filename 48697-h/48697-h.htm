<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The varying fortunes of the obstinate and fiercely
contested struggles with the Dutch for maritime and
commercial supremacy in the days of the Commonwealth
and the Restoration are familiar to all readers
of English history, and especially of English naval
history. Never did English seamen fight better than
in these Dutch wars, and never did they meet more
redoubtable foes. The details of the many dogged
contests marked by alternate victory and defeat are
now more or less unintelligible save to the expert in
the naval strategy and tactics of the times, but legends
have grown round the story of Martin Tromp sailing
down the Channel with a broom at his mast-head, and
of the exploit of Michael de Ruyter in burning the
English ships at Chatham, which are never likely to be
forgotten. The names of these two famous seamen
are probably better known to Englishmen than those
of any of the contemporary English admirals save that
of Robert Blake alone. This fact should bespeak for
the attempt that is here made to trace the causes and
the growth of the Anglo-Dutch rivalry at sea and in
commerce, which culminated in the collision between
Blake and Tromp off Dover on May 29, 1652, and
the declaration of war that followed. It has been my
object in these Ford Lectures to treat of the relations
between England and the United Provinces during the
half-century that preceded the first outbreak of hostilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and to make it clear that these wars of 1652-4,
1665-7, 1672-4 were the inevitable outcome of a long-continued
clashing of interests, which were of fundamental
importance and indeed vital to the welfare of
both nations.</p>

<p>The first half of the seventeenth century was one of
the most critical periods in English history. In any
account of the reigns of the first two sovereigns of the
House of Stewart political and religious questions of
primary significance thrust themselves into the foreground
of a picture full of deepening dramatic interest,
with the result that other questions, apparently subordinate
but in reality closely bound up with the
national destinies, have been either relegated to the
background or wholly overlooked and neglected. It
has been so in regard to the questions dealt with in
these pages.</p>

<p>The history of the revolt of the Netherlands and of
the rise of the Dutch Republic shows to us Englishmen
and Dutchmen united by bonds of sympathy and fighting
side by side against a common foe. To both
alike the Spaniard and the Inquisition were hateful,
and in shedding their blood freely for the cause of
Dutch freedom Englishmen were in fact acting in their
own self-defence against the ambitious projects of
Philip II. At first sight then it appears strange that
the conclusion of the truce for twelve years in 1609
should have been followed by a coolness and growing
estrangement in the relations between the two countries,
and by a series of endless bickerings, grievances,
and disputes which all the resources of diplomacy in
protracted negotiations proved unable to settle amicably
to the satisfaction of both parties. The truth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that the very points of resemblance in the racial
characteristics of the English and the Dutch brought
them into collision in almost every part of the world.
Born colonizers, traders, and explorers, each people was
instinctively conscious that its destiny was upon the
water, and that mastery of the seas was a necessity of
national existence. Hence a rivalry which was unavoidable,
inexorable, a rivalry which could eventually
have only one of two issues, either the voluntary
submission of one of the rivals to the other, or a trial
of strength by ordeal of battle.</p>

<p>James I and Charles I, whatever the deficiencies and
mistakes of their foreign policies, were not blind to the
significance of the appearance of this new sea-power on
the other side of the 'narrow seas', and were quick
to recognize that the Dutch menace to the essential
interests of their island kingdom was at least as
formidable as the Spanish menace had ever been. The
diplomacy of both these kings was on the face of it
vacillating, uncertain, and opportunist, but it is unjust
to attribute this wholly to constitutional infirmity of
purpose, or to an innate propensity to carry through
their schemes by tortuous by-ways and dubious intrigues.
There was no lack of steadfast determination
on the part either of James or Charles in their resolute
attempts to conduct the government and administration
of their kingdoms autocratically without that adequate
financial aid which Parliament alone could grant. But
in consequence their treasury was generally empty, and
it is therefore not surprising that, confronted with the
constant fear of imminent bankruptcy, they were
compelled to be shifty in their dealings with foreign
powers, and to work for the achievement of their ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
by the processes of a devious diplomacy rather than
risk the costly charges of an appeal to arms. Nevertheless
it will be seen that in their negotiations with
the United Provinces never for a single moment would
either James or Charles make the slightest concession
in regard to the claims of the British Crown to undisputed
sovereignty 'in the narrow seas', and they
insisted that every foreign vessel should recognize that
sovereignty by striking its flag when meeting a British
war-ship in those waters.</p>

<p>The period with which I am dealing was one of
chartered companies, of trade monopolies, and of commercial
protection in its most aggressive form. Probably
at that stage in the world's history no other
economical system was conceivable or would have
proved workable. In any case most of the disputes
and differences between the English and the Dutch at
this time arose from questions connected with trading
privileges, and these lectures contain much concerning
them. It is still, however, extremely interesting and
not without instruction to read the arguments that were
used and the principles that were upheld by these
statesmen and diplomatists of former days. Economical
questions are always with us, and men's opinions differ
now as to their right solution as much as they did three
centuries ago.</p>

<h2>I: 1600-1610</h2>


<p>The last two decades of the sixteenth century hold
a place apart in English History. The exploits of the
great Elizabethan seamen helped to shatter the
supremacy of Spain upon the sea, but they did more
than this. They aroused in the English people the
instinct of their true destiny, as a maritime, trading,
and colonizing power. The granting of Charters to
the Eastland (Baltic) Company (1579), to the Levant
Company (1581), to the Guinea Company (1588), the
foundation of the great East India Company (1600),
the opening out by the Muscovy Company of a new
trade route to Persia by way of Astrachan, the daring
efforts to discover a North-West and a North-East
passage to Cathay and the Indies, the first attempts to
erect colonies in Virginia and Newfoundland, all testify
to the spirit of enterprise which animated the nation,
a spirit whose many-sided activity never failed to
command the Queen's sympathy and encouragement.
In thus entering, however, upon that path of colonial
and commercial expansion which in later times was to
become world-wide, the Englishman found himself in
the first half of the seventeenth century confronted by
a more formidable rival than the Spaniard. The defeat
of the Invincible Armada was followed<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by the rise of
a new Sea-Power. At the opening of the seventeenth
century the Dutch Republic had not only succeeded
in resisting all the efforts made for its subjugation to
Spanish rule, but, after more than thirty years of continuous
and desperate struggle, was thriving in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
midst of war. In the course of that struggle much
help had been given, both in money and men, by
Elizabeth. But the English Queen was not for many
years whole-hearted in her support. She saw in the
revolt of the Netherlands a means for draining the
resources of a dangerous adversary. It was no small
relief to her that the coast lying opposite to the mouth
of the Thames, with its many ports and hardy sea-faring
population, should no longer be at the disposal of the
master of the strongest navy in the world. She felt
a certain amount of sympathy with the Dutch on religious
grounds, but a sympathy tempered by political
considerations, and strictly subordinated to them. To
support the rebellion of subjects against their legitimate
ruler was to the instincts of the Tudor Queen a course
which only necessity could justify. Hence her repeated
refusal of the proffered sovereignty, her niggardly aid,
her temporizing and apparently capricious attitude.
As a matter of fact, throughout this critical period of
her reign the policy of Elizabeth was not governed
either by sentiment or by caprice. She always kept
steadily in view the welfare and the security of England,
with whose interests those of her own throne were
identified, and she held aloof from entanglements which
might be dangerous to the safety of her kingdom.
Not until after the assassination of William the Silent,
followed by the success of Parma in capturing Antwerp,
August, 1585, did she make reply to the threatening
attitude of Spain by openly taking sides with the rebel
provinces. Still refusing the sovereignty, she sent
Leicester at the head of a strong body of English
troops to act in her name, as Governor-General, at the
same time characteristically bargaining that the seaports<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Flushing and Brill with the fort of Rammekens
should be delivered to her in pledge for the repayment
of her costs. The mission of Leicester was a failure,
whether it be regarded from the military or the political
standpoint, but it gave the Dutch at a transition period
of disorganization and pressing peril a disciplined force
to assist in their defence, and a breathing space for
recuperation.</p>

<p>The resignation of his post by Leicester (April, 1588)
may be taken as the date at which the history of the
United Netherlands as a self-governing State really
begins. The treaty with England still subsisted by
the terms of which the Commander of the English
auxiliary troops with two colleagues had seats in the
Council of State, but the Council of State ceased ere
long to have any but executive functions. The conduct
of affairs affecting the whole Union was vested in the
States-General as representing the States of the seven
sovereign provinces from which its authority was
derived. A more cumbrous system of government
than that under which the United Provinces were
now to develop rapidly into a powerful and flourishing
State, probably never existed. That it was workable
was due to two facts. The voices of the provinces
were nominally of equal weight in the States-General,
in reality that of Holland was dominant. Holland
contributed 60 per cent. of the general expenses and
contained about one-half of the entire population of the
Union. With Zeeland she furnished almost the whole
of the navy and was already becoming one of the most
thriving centres of commerce in the world. At this
time the influence of an exceptionally able statesman,
John van Oldenbarneveldt, who filled the office of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Advocate of Holland, was supreme in the States of
that province, and as their representative and spokesman
he was able to exercise an authority in the States-General
which placed for thirty years in his hands the
general administration of the country and the control
of foreign affairs. By his side stood Maurice of Nassau,
respected and honoured as the son of William the
Silent, wielding as Captain and Admiral-General
authority over all the armed forces of the Republic,
and exercising as Stadholder of five provinces large
executive powers. A consummate general but no
politician, Maurice was content to leave the business
of administration and the conduct of diplomacy in the
hands of the statesman who had been his father's friend.
Thus by the efforts of these two men, each eminent in
his separate sphere, the youthful Republic, despite the
inherent weaknesses of a confederacy so loosely compacted
as that of the United Provinces, was able to
carry out a wise and consistent foreign policy, to defend
its borders, and meanwhile to thrive and flourish.</p>

<p>The relations between England and the States
required the most careful handling during the whole
of the period that intervened between the return of
Leicester and the death of Elizabeth. The assistance
given by the English Queen had not been without
a return: it had been fully repaid by the services
rendered by the Dutch fleet during the spring and
summer of 1588 in blockading the ports in which lay
the transports collected by the Duke of Parma for the
invasion of England. When the Armada entered the
Channel, Parma with his splendid veteran army was
thus compelled to remain a helpless spectator of events,
unable to take any part in promoting the success of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the great enterprise which Philip had been so long
preparing. But Elizabeth had been piqued by the
opposition that Leicester had encountered, and by the
evident determination of the States, under the leadership
of Holland, not to permit any interference on
the part of the representative of a foreign power with
their provincial rights and privileges. She did not
withdraw her help, but it was given from motives of
pure self-interest rather than from any love for the
cause she was supporting, and in a huckstering spirit.
With her it was a question of give and take, and the
military successes of Maurice, accompanied as they
were by the rapid growth of commercial prosperity in
Holland and Zeeland, only encouraged her to drive
a harder bargain in her negotiations and to press for
repayment of the loans she had advanced.</p>

<p>In these circumstances friction in the relations
between England and the Republic was at times
inevitable, but the community of interests was so
strong that friendly co-operation never ceased. An
English contingent took part in the campaigns of
Maurice; a powerful Dutch squadron sailed with the
fleet of Essex to the sack of Cadiz in 1595. The
conclusion of peace between France and Spain in
May, 1598, brought about a fresh treaty between
England and the United Provinces, the terms of which
point clearly to the great change which had taken
place in the relative position of the two States since
the time of Leicester's mission. The Dutch were now
in a position to promise the repayment of their debt
to Elizabeth by equal annual instalments<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
in case of a Spanish attack upon England to
come to the assistance of their allies with thirty ships
of war and a force of 5,000 infantry and five cornets
of cavalry. On the other hand, only one Englishman
henceforth was to have a seat upon the Council of
State, and the English auxiliary troops in the Netherlands
were transferred to the service of the States as
their paymasters and were required to take an oath
of allegiance to them. This English brigade in the
Dutch service, now first formed, was to have a long
and honourable career. It was speedily to prove its
worth and gain immortal fame by the share that
it took in winning the great victory of Nieuwport
(July 2, 1600), and in the heroic defence of Ostend
(1601-4).</p>

<p>Such was the state of things when James I ascended
the English throne. From him the Netherlands could
hope for little active aid. The chief aim of James's
policy from the first was to live on friendly terms with
Spain, and in 1604 he concluded a treaty of peace
with Philip III and with the Archdukes, as sovereigns
of the Netherlands. His attitude to the United Provinces
was not indeed unfriendly. He still retained
the cautionary towns, as a pledge for the debt, and his
representative sat in the Council of State, but as one
of the conditions of peace he promised to lend no
assistance to the Dutch. The privilege of recruiting
in England for the regiments in their service was not
withdrawn, but in return a like privilege was extended
to the Spaniards. Thus there were occasions on which
Englishmen were found fighting against one another
on opposite sides. The Court of Madrid on their
part, exhausted by the long and costly struggle, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
already in 1606 making tentative proposals to the
rebel provinces for the conclusion of a peace or truce,
and meanwhile spared no efforts to prejudice the
mind of James against a people for whose cause as
a stanch Protestant it was feared he might have
secret leanings, and at the same time to secure his
benevolent support in the coming negotiations. The
arguments that were used and their effect upon the
King are well summed up in the words of the keen-eyed
Venetian Ambassador, Nicolò Molin, who in 1607
thus reports:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The Spaniards are ceaselessly urging upon the
King that for his own interests he ought to use his
utmost endeavours in this negotiation in order to bring
it to some conclusion, since by continuance of the war
the Dutch might come to make themselves masters of
those seas. Having their fleets ordinarily of a hundred
or more ships, and these widely scattered in different
places, they can thus say, and with truth, that they are
masters of those seas for the possession of which the
ancient kings of England have made very long and
very costly wars against the princes of Europe. The
King knows all this to be true, but is likewise of
opinion that at a single nod of his the Dutch would
yield to him all that dominion that they have gained;
which without doubt would follow so long as the war
with the Spaniards lasted, since they are not able at
one and the same time to contend with two of the
greatest princes of Christendom. But if with time
that ripens affairs peace should be effected between
them and the Crown of Spain, I do not know if they
would be so ready to yield as the King of England
promises himself; since just as this profession of the
sea is manifestly more and more on the wane in England,
so more and more is it increasing and acquiring
force and vigour among the Dutch.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The perspicacity of this review of the situation was
completely justified by the events. On April 9, 1609,
after prolonged and acrimonious negotiations, a treaty
for a truce of twelve years between the belligerents
was signed, but on conditions imposed by the Dutch.
To the Spaniards the terrible drain on their resources
made a respite from war a matter not of choice, but of
necessity. To obtain it they had to treat with the
United Provinces 'as if they were an independent
State', and, worst of all, they had by a secret clause to
concede liberty of trading in the Indies. From this
moment the relations of the States with England were
sensibly changed. The attitude of King James had
hitherto been a mixture of condescension and aloofness,
and he had not troubled himself to consider
seriously the question of Dutch rivalry upon the seas
and in commerce, which had so profoundly impressed
the Venetian envoy. Nicolò Molin was in 1607 undoubtedly
correct in his supposition that at that date
James still looked upon the Dutch as dependents on
his favour, who would not venture to run counter to
any expression of his will. The course of the negotiations
for the truce must have gradually undeceived
him, and their issue left him face to face with a power
compelled to maintain to the utmost the interests of
the extensive commerce on the proceeds of which its
very existence as a State depended.</p>

<p>No sooner were the signatures appended to the
treaty than James took a step which exposed to a
very severe strain his relations with the people whose
emancipation from Spanish rule he had, ostensibly at
least, worked hard to accomplish. Many indeed in
Holland had been suspicious of the real friendliness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
his attitude during the negotiations, but very few
probably imagined that he was preparing, as soon as
they were ended, to put to the test their sense of the
value of his services and of his alliance by striking
a deadly blow at the most important of their industries.
On May 16, 1609, the King issued a proclamation,
in which, after stating that though he had hitherto
tolerated the promiscuous liberty that had been
granted to foreigners to fish in the British seas, he has
now determined, seeing that this liberty</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'hath not only given occasion of over great Encroachments
upon our Regalities, or rather questioning of
our Right, but hath been a means of daily Wrongs to
our own People that exercise the Trade of Fishing ... to
give notice to all the World that our express
Pleasure is, that from the beginning of the Month of
August next coming, no Person of what Nation or
Quality soever, be permitted to fish upon any of our
Coasts and Seas of Great Britain, Ireland and the rest
of the Isles adjacent, until they have orderly demanded
and obtain'd Licences from us....'</p></blockquote>

<p>The news of the publication of this edict caused in
Holland no small surprise, not unmingled with indignation.
On June 12 the matter was discussed in the
States of that Province, and it was resolved<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that the
States-General be requested to adopt measures for
the vigorous defence of the land's rights as based
upon the treaties. The States-General on their part
resolved<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that a full inquiry should be made into the
question of treaty rights and a special embassy be
sent to London, and as early as July 6, King James
agreed<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> to receive such a deputation, and to appoint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
commissioners to enter into conference with it on the
subject of the privileges and immunities for freedom of
commerce claimed in virtue of ancient treaties. Meanwhile
the States-General promised the fishermen their
protection, at the same time bidding them to be very
careful not to give any cause for new complaints on
the part of the King. So far indeed were the Dutch
from yielding immediate submission to the demand of
James, or from admitting its justice, that Sir Ralph
Winwood (the resident English ambassador at the
Hague), reporting to the Secretary of State, Lord
Salisbury, the results of an interview he had had with
Oldenbarneveldt September 16, 1609, informs him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'the States do write expressly to their ambassador
[Noel Caron] urging him to advertise his Majesty their
purpose to send to beseech him upon the necessity of
this affair [i.e. liberty of fishing] in the meantime to
have patience with their people trading upon his coast
that without impeachment they may use <em>their accustomed
Liberty and antient Privelidges</em>; which he
[Oldenbarneveldt] said they were so far from fear
that his Majesty upon due consideration will abridge,
as that they hope he will be pleased to inlarge and
increase into new ones.'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For a right understanding of the importance of the
fisheries question and of the reasons which led
King James at this particular time to issue his proclamation,
a short retrospect is necessary.</p>

<p>Special rights of free fishing in English waters had
been granted to the Hollanders and Zeelanders, as early
as 1295, by King Edward I, and afterwards renewed by
several of his successors. Finally a treaty was concluded,
dated February 24, 1496, known as the <i>Magnus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<i>Intercursus</i>, between Henry VII and Philip the Fair,
Duke of Burgundy, which was destined to regulate the
commercial relations between England and the Netherlands
during the whole of the Tudor period, and was
still in force in 1609. Article XIV of this treaty ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Conventum, concordatum et conclusum est quod
Piscatores utriusque Partis Partium praedictarum
(cujuscunque conditionis existant) poterunt ubique Ire,
Navigare per Mare, secure Piscari absque aliquo Impedimento,
Licentia, seu Salvo Conductu.'</p></blockquote>

<p class="noind">Nothing could be more explicit or complete, and it
was to this clause of the <i>Magnus Intercursus</i> and
the rights it had so long recognized that Oldenbarneveldt
referred when he spoke to Winwood of the
Dutch fishermen's 'accustomed Liberty and antient
Privelidges.'</p>

<p>The rights of the Netherlanders to trade and navigate
in Scottish waters, 'sine aliquo salvo conductu aut
licentia generali aut speciali', were guaranteed by the
Treaty of Binche, dated December 15, 1550, which had
been confirmed by James himself, as King of Scotland,
in 1594. But neither in this treaty of 1550, nor in an
earlier treaty of 1541 to which it expressly refers,
'<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa Piscationem et liberum usum Maris, ea quae per
Tractatum anno 1541</i> ... inita, conclusa ac conventa
fuerint debite ac sincere observari debebunt', is there
any definite statement that the free use of the sea
carried with it the right to fish without payment, though
undoubtedly that right seems to be implied, and was
certainly exercised without let or hindrance before 1609.</p>

<p>The question at issue was of vital consequence to the
Dutch. It may be asserted without any exaggeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
that the commerce and prosperity of Holland and
Zeeland had been built upon the herring fishery, and
rested upon it. The discovering of the art of curing
the herring by Willem Beukelsz at the close of the
fourteenth century had transformed a perishable article
of local consumption into a commodity for traffic and
exchange. Soon the 'great fishery', as it was called,
afforded, directly or indirectly, occupation and a means
of livelihood to a large part of the entire population of
the Province of Holland.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Not only did many thousands
of Hollanders put out to sea to follow the track
of the herring shoals along the British coasts, but
thousands more found employment on shore in building
the busses, pinks, and other boats engaged in the lucrative
industry, and in providing them with ropes, nets,
and other necessaries. The profit from the fishery
alone before the outbreak of the revolt was estimated
by Guicciardini at 500,000 Flemish pounds. But such
an estimate was far from representing the real value of
what was styled by the States-General in an official
document 'one of the chiefest mines of the United
Netherlands'.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Salt was required for the curing. It
was brought in Dutch bottoms in its rough state from
French and Spanish ports, or direct from Punta del
Rey on the coast of Venezuela, and salt-refineries
quickly sprang up at Enkhuysen, Hoorn, and other
fishing centres. In a land which had no natural products,
the cured herrings and the refined salt which were
not required for home use served as articles of commerce,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and freights were dispatched to the neighbouring
lands but specially to the Baltic to be exchanged
for corn, timber, hemp, and other 'Eastland' commodities.
The enterprising Hollanders and Zeelanders,
at first competed with the Hanse towns in the Baltic
ports, but long before the opening of the seventeenth
century had practically driven their rivals from the field,
and at the time with which we are dealing it has been
computed that no less than 3,000 Dutch vessels were
engaged in the 'Eastland' traffic through the Sound.
The corn in its turn brought by so vast a fleet far more
than sufficed even for the needs of a country where no
corn was grown. Some thousands of other ships laden
with grain voyaged along the coast of France, the
Peninsula and the Western Mediterranean, discharging
their cargoes and returning with freights of wine, silk,
olive oil, and other staple products of the South. The
Spaniards and Portuguese were in fact largely dependent
upon the Hollanders for their necessary food
supplies, and these keen traders had no scruples in
enriching themselves at the cost of their foes. An abundance
of timber and hemp also came from the Baltic
and furnished the raw material for flourishing shipbuilding
and ropemaking industries. Sawmills sprang
up on the banks of the Zaan, and before long Zaandam
became the chief centre of the timber trade of Europe.
It will thus be seen at once how many Dutch interests
were involved in the full maintenance of the rights to
free fishing on the British coasts guaranteed by treaty,
and why it was that the States-General under pressure
from the States of Holland should have determined to
send a special embassy to protest strongly and firmly
against the edict of King James, and should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
meantime promised the fishermen their protection in
case of any attempt being made to compel them by
armed force to pay the licences.</p>

<p>The step taken by King James had, however, from
the English point of view much to recommend it. The
English people saw the growing maritime strength and
rapidly increasing commercial prosperity of the Dutch
with jealous eyes. Their practical monopoly of the
British fisheries was deeply resented. Pamphlets were
written lamenting the decadence of English shipping
and trade.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It was felt that the ancient claim of England
to the sovereignty and dominion of the narrow
seas was being challenged, and that its maintenance
depended upon the numbers and the experience of the
sea-faring population, for whom the fisheries were the
best and most practical school. A petition is extant
from the fishermen of the Cinque Ports to the King,
showing that the Netherlanders drive them from their
fishing, and sell fresh fish contrary to the laws, and beseeching
His Majesty to impose on them a tax of fifteen
shillings upon every last of fish, the same as they imposed
on the English.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> James was far from indisposed
to listen to their complaints. Early in his reign, in
1604, an attempt had been made to enforce the eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of fish in England on fast-days, and the motive of it
was plainly stated. It had little to do with religious
observances. It was 'for the better increase of Seamen,
to be readie at all times to serve in the Kings Majesties
Navie, of which the fishermen of England have euer
been the chiefest Seminarie and Nurserie.'<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The
suggestion that licences should be required for which
a tax or toll should be paid naturally presented
itself to the King, at this time in sore straits for money
and at his wit's end how to obtain it, as a welcome
expedient. It also afforded a means by which the sovereignty
and jurisdiction of the British King in the
British seas could be asserted and his regalities safeguarded.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The large revenue derived by Christian IV
of Denmark from the tolls in the Sound had no doubt
often made the impecunious James envious of his
brother-in-law, whose right to levy such an import in
Danish waters differed in no way from the right, which
as King of Great Britain and Ireland he was now
asserting, to demand a licence from all foreigners who
desired to fish on the British coasts. His decision to
issue the proclamation was confirmed by the appearance
in March, 1609, of the famous treatise of Hugo
Grotius, entitled <cite>Mare Liberum</cite>. The argument in
this work seemed to be directed against the principle
of a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominium maris</i> such as the English Kings had
claimed for centuries in the 'narrow seas', and its
publication at this time aroused the resentment of
James, always tenaciously jealous of any infringement
of his sovereign prerogatives. As a matter of fact, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
has been shown by the late Professor Robert Fruin<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>,
the <cite>Mare Liberum</cite> was originally a chapter of a larger
unpublished work of Grotius, written to prove that the
Portuguese had no exclusive rights in the Indian Ocean
but that the Eastern seas and all others were open to
the traders of every nation. The most burning question
in the negotiations for the twelve years' truce, then
just drawing to a close, had been that of the liberty to
trade in the Indies, demanded with insistence by the
Dutch, refused up to the very last peremptorily by the
Spanish King, and conceded by him finally not directly
but by a kind of subterfuge. The <cite>Mare Liberum</cite> of
Grotius saw the light at a time when it was hoped that
his learned arguments might tend to allay the acuteness
of the dispute by showing the reasonableness and
legality of the position taken up by the Dutch. It is
clear now that these arguments, though their application
was general, had their special reference to Portuguese
and not to British pretensions. Curiously enough,
as will be seen later, it was in the long succession of
Anglo-Dutch negotiations over the fisheries in the seas
over which the Crown of England claimed paramount
sovereignty and jurisdiction that the thesis put forward
by the author of the <cite>Mare Liberum</cite> was destined to
be the source of embittered controversy. The acute
mind of King James was quick in grasping its importance.</p>

<p>Delayed by various causes, it was not till April 16,
1610, that the embassy from the States set sail from
Brill for England. The object of the mission was
ostensibly a complimentary one&mdash;to thank the King
for the active part he had taken, as a mediator, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
bringing the truce negotiations to a favourable issue.
The two matters which called for serious discussion
were: (1) the critical situation which had arisen in the
Jülich-Cleves Duchies owing to a disputed succession;
(2) the proclamation about the fisheries. The importance
of the last question was revealed by the fact
that all the five envoys originally selected were representatives
of the two maritime provinces. One of the
five died at Brill just before starting. The four who
actually sailed (April 16) were: Johan Berck, pensionary
of Dort; Albert de Veer, pensionary of
Amsterdam; Elias van Oldenbarneveldt, pensionary
of Rotterdam; and a Zeelander, Albert Joachimi, who
was later to show himself a skilful diplomatist during
the twenty-five years that he was resident Dutch
ambassador in London. Elias van Oldenbarneveldt
was the brother of the Advocate of Holland. According
to a letter from Sir Ralph Winwood<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> to Lord
Salisbury he had special charge of the fishery question,
a proof of the peculiar interest felt by the Advocate in
the issue raised. With them was joined the resident
ambassador, Noel Caron. Their instructions required
them to seek from His Majesty an explanation of his
intentions in the proclamation, 'since their High
Mightinesses the States-General could not believe
that he meant to include the inhabitants of the
United Netherlands among those who were bidden
to pay for a licence to fish, since this was contrary
to the ancient treaties subsisting between them
and the Crowns of England and Scotland. After
audiences with the King (April 27) and with the Privy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Council (May 8), it was arranged that a Conference
on the fisheries question should be held,
with a Committee of the Council, two of whose members
were Sir Julius Caesar, Chancellor of the
Exchequer, and Sir Thomas Parry, Chancellor of the
Duchy of Lancaster. The Conference opened on
May 16, and the points in dispute were argued at
length. The Dutch case was presented in a memorandum
drawn up with much skill, probably by the
hand of Hugo Grotius himself. The freedom of
fishing was claimed on two grounds: (1) that of the
privileges granted by ancient treaties still in force;
(2) that of abstract right, because the sea, like the air,
is for the common use of all and cannot be private
property. The weak point of the case lay in the fact
that these two grounds, that of treaty right and that
of the <cite>Mare Liberum</cite>, seemed to be in a certain sense
contradictory. The English, however, would not admit
that the question of the immemorial claim of the Kings
of England to sovereignty and jurisdiction in the seas
adjoining the British coasts was open to discussion,
and seizing upon the argument placed in their hands
by the Dutch memorandum itself, pleaded with great
force that the granting of privileges implied the power
to take them away or modify them, should the King
deem such a step necessary to protect the interests of
his own subjects. The Conference therefore effected
nothing more than the bringing out in relief of the
differences of view of the two parties. But reflection
brought wisdom. There was no wish on either side
to press matters to extremities. Already on May 10
the States-General, unwilling to run the risk of making
James an enemy, at a time when they were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
anxious to secure his help in the settlement of the
Jülich-Cleves succession question<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, had sent instructions
to their ambassadors not to make difficulties or unpleasantness
about the fisheries, but rather to propose
that the execution of the proclamation should be
postponed for two years, in order that the question
might be thoroughly investigated. There were several
claimants to the Jülich-Cleves inheritance, Protestant
and Catholic, and it was of vital importance to the
States, and also to a lesser extent to all Protestant
princes in Germany and to James, that this frontier
territory on the Rhine should not fall under the rule
of a Catholic sovereign. But the Archduke Leopold
had seized the fortress of Jülich, and Henry IV of
France, jealous of the power of the House of Habsburg
in Europe, had put himself at the head of a coalition
to secure the succession to the Elector of Brandenburg,
and William, Count Palatine of Neuburg, as joint
possessors. There was a general desire to avoid
hostilities, but Henry IV had pushed forward his
preparations for a great campaign, and war seemed
inevitable. At this moment the assassination of the
French king at the very time the Conference was
being held in London changed the whole aspect of
affairs. The new French Government was favourably
disposed to Spain. The Dutch therefore were left
face to face with the task of expelling the Archduke
from Jülich, and they felt that all other matters were
for the moment of secondary importance to that of
having the friendly co-operation of James in case of the
outbreak of war. Their attitude to the fisheries question
was therefore considerably modified. It became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
much more conciliatory, and for precisely similar reasons
a like change took place in the attitude of the English
King. He too felt that the friendship of the Dutch
was essential to him at such a critical juncture, and at
a meeting with the Earls of Salisbury and Northampton,
May 24, the Dutch envoys were agreeably surprised
to find that the King, while not formally abating one
jot of his sovereign rights in the matter of issuing
licences for fishing, was willing to postpone the execution
of his edict for two years. The ambassadors took
leave of the King the same day and started on their
return journey. Of this audience the Lords of the
Council, in a letter to Winwood, dated May 18, 1610
(o.s.), write:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'For the States Ambassadors, His Majesty is now
dismissing them with sufficient assurance of his inward
affections towards them and the preservation of their
State, which next to his own he holdeth most dear
above all other respects in the world. And as for the
matter of fishing and Reglement of commerce, His
Majesty thinketh not fit now to spend any more time
in it, but to refer the one and the other to some better
season; and in the meanwhile that things may remain
in the same state as now they are. So as we conceive
these Deputies will return with good contentment,
having no other cause either for the public or for the
private; and His Majesty having also been careful to
give them the rights that appertain to their title,
and all other external courtesy and honour in their
reception.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This good understanding was to bear good fruit.
The army, which Maurice of Nassau led into the duchy
in June, contained a fine body of English troops under
the command of Sir Edward Cecil. Jülich was besieged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and surrendered to the Dutch on September 1, and
the Archduke Leopold was compelled to leave the
territory. Of this achievement Sir Ralph Winwood,
writing to Lord Salisbury from Dusseldorf, August 22
(o.s.), says: 'The honor of the conduct of this seige
no man will detract from the Count Maurice, who is the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maistre-ouvrier</i> in that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mestier</i>. But that this Seige
hath had so happy an end, himself will and doth attribute
it to the Diligence and Judgement of Sir Edward
Cecil.' The capture of Jülich did not indeed end this
thorny little dispute. Anglo-Dutch and Spanish-Imperial
armies, under Maurice and Spinola respectively,
man&oelig;uvred within a short distance of one
another. But the quarrel was localized, no further
hostilities took place, and finally by the Treaty of
Xanten, November 12, 1614, an arrangement was
arrived at. During all this time the relations between
James and the States were friendly. The King, however,
had quarrelled with his Parliament, and even had
he wished to take a stronger line in foreign politics,
lack of funds compelled him to temporize. The
English contingent in Maurice's army was recruited
indeed in England, but the troops were in the pay of
the States. Moreover, James was all the time hankering
after a Spanish marriage for the Prince of Wales, from
mixed motives doubtless, but chiefly from a misguided
notion that such an alliance between the leading
Catholic and the leading Protestant State would
enable him to play the part of arbiter in the religious
differences which were dividing Europe into two
hostile camps, and by his influence to prevent an
actual breach of the peace. This was the underlying
motive which prompted all the apparent fluctuations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of his policy. Hence the persistence with which for
so many years he pursued the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">chimaera</i> of a Spanish
match, while at the same time he allowed his only
daughter to marry the Elector Palatine, the head of
the Protestant Union in Germany, and endeavoured
to maintain good relations with the United Provinces,
notwithstanding the continual friction between his
subjects and the Dutch regarding the increasing
monopoly by the latter of the fisheries and of sea-borne
trade. The situation in 1611 is thus described
by the Venetian, Marcantonio Correr<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'With the lords of the United Provinces of the Low
Countries, there exists at present perfect friendship
and union; formerly he [James] used to despise them,
as rebels, but now he loves and esteems them, as
princes of valour and quality, an effect of the truce
made with the Catholic king.... Now H.M. desires
and procures the preservation of the Dutch, but not
a further increase of their greatness, since their forces
on sea are not inferior to those of any potentate
whatsoever, because that in time of war necessity has
been their best mistress. Of these forces the English
are not without some jealousy, seeing their own diminished,
and the dominion of the sea, that they have been
accustomed to hold in that part of the ocean transferred
to others.... In the herring fishery alone they [the
Dutch] send out every year to the east coast of the
Kingdom of England 1,700 vessels, in which perhaps
30,000 men are employed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> After the truce the King
made a proclamation, that no one was allowed to fish
in those parts without licence, perhaps incited by the
great sums of money, that formerly the Spaniards
offered Queen Elizabeth to have the user of it; but
just as at that time that scheming did not succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
despoiling the Dutch, so now these with two special
ambassadors have not obtained any promise of an
alteration, as he [the King] is always intent upon the
conservation of his jurisdiction and the increase of the
royal incomings. The King at present regards the
possession of such great sea power as being in itself of
great moment for the needs of England, and united
with his own it could with difficulty be resisted. He
holds further that these same provinces are a barrier
rampart of his kingdoms, and he is interested in them
through the debt of a million and a half of gold that
remains to him of the sum of more than two millions
already lent by Queen Elizabeth, the repayment of
which is at present spread over a number of years, a
portion every year. Meanwhile three principal places
are pledges in the hands of his Majesty....'</p></blockquote>

<p>The possession of these fortresses was indeed at
this time placing King James in a position of no small
advantage in his dealings with the States, and he was
well aware of it. On the other hand, it was galling to
the Dutch, now that they had compelled the Spaniard
to treat with the United Provinces as if it were an
independent State, to feel that two chief doors of
entrance into their land were in the hands of foreign
garrisons. James professed to be their good friend,
and it appeared to be his interest to cultivate their
alliance, but it was inevitable that his assiduous advances
to gain the goodwill of Spain and to obtain the hand
of an Infanta for his son should render him suspect.</p>

<h2>II: 1610-1618</h2>


<p>The resolve of the King in 1610 to postpone any
action in the matter of his proclamation on the fisheries
question seems not to have aroused any popular
expression of disapproval. The English people were
from the political and religious standpoint well disposed
to the Dutch. What they suspected and dreaded
was the King's obvious leaning to Spain. Their intense
dislike to the Spanish marriage, concerning
which it was common knowledge that negotiations were
on foot, led them to favour a good understanding with
the United Provinces. But the spectacle of the growing
Dutch monopoly of the carrying trade, and the
decline of English commerce in the face of these formidable
rivals, could not fail before long to stir public
opinion.</p>

<p>A succession of noteworthy pamphlets drew attention
to the subject. Foremost among these, from the
personality of the writer, was Ralegh's<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> <cite>Observations
touching trade and commerce with the Hollanders and
others, wherein is proved that our sea and land commodities
serve to enrich and strengthen other countries
than our own</cite>. These <cite>Observations</cite> were, as the title
page informs us, presented to King James, and there
are indications that the date of their presentation was
about the time of the Dutch embassy of 1610. Their
object was to show how Dutch trade was prospering at
the expense of that of England. Ralegh pointed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
in particular the immense profit derived by the Hollanders
from their fishing in the British seas, and he
asks why 'this great sea-business of fishing' should
not be kept in English hands, and suggests that the
King should appoint Commissioners to inquire into
the matter, and 'forthwith set forward some scheme
for preventing foreigners from reaping all the fruits of
this lucrative industry on his Majesty's coasts.' He
warns the King that 'the Hollanders possess already
as many ships as eleven kingdoms, England being one
of them', and expresses his conviction that 'they [the
Hollanders] hoped to get the whole trade and shipping
of Christendom into their own hands, as well for transportation,
as otherwise for the command and mastery
of the seas.'</p>

<p>Ralegh's pamphlet did not affect the King's decision
to defer, for political reasons, taking any active steps
concerning the fisheries, but we may well believe that
the hint about 'the command and mastery of the seas'
would not pass unheeded. It touched a question
about which James was peculiarly sensitive. That
question, though for a few years apparently dormant,
was one that neither King nor people could afford to
disregard. The command of the sea&mdash;then as at all
times&mdash;was vital to an island power. The English
were beginning to see in the Dutch not merely competitors
in trade, who were ousting them from every
market, but possible rivals for the dominion even of
those 'narrow seas<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>' in which the Kings of England
had so long claimed to have paramount sovereignty
and jurisdiction. Thus a feeling of dissatisfaction and
resentment gathered head which found vent, as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the custom of those days, in political pamphlet-writing.
Two of these pamphlets<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, no less than that of Ralegh,
call for particular notice, for they are full of material
bearing upon the subject of the relations between the
English and Dutch at the time of their publication,
and throwing light upon the causes of the growing
estrangement between the two people.</p>

<p><cite>England's Way to win Wealth</cite>, by Tobias Gentleman,
Fisherman and Mariner, bears the date 1614.
The purpose of the writer is thoroughly practical. He
sets out in great detail the statistics of the fisheries on
the British coasts, and of the immense profits derived
by the Hollanders from the pursuit of this industry,
and he then proceeds to urge upon his countrymen to
take a lesson from the foreigners, and not to neglect,
as they are doing, a source of wealth which lies at
their very doors. The following quotation is a good
specimen of the homely vigour and directness of
Gentleman's arguments; it will be seen that here, as
throughout the pamphlet, they profess to be based on
his own personal experience:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'What their [the Hollanders] chiefest trade is, or
their principal gold mine is well known to all merchants,
that have used those parts, and to myself and
all fishermen; namely, that his Majesty's seas is their
chiefest, principal, and only rich treasury whereby they
have so long maintained their wars, and have so
greatly prospered and enriched themselves. If their
little country of the United Provinces can do this (as
is most manifest before our eyes they do) then what
may we, his Majesty's subjects, do, if this trade of
fishing were once erected among us, we having, in our
own countries, sufficient store of all necessaries to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
accomplish the like business?... And shall we
neglect so great blessings, O slothful England and
careless countrymen! Look but on these fellows, that
we call the plump Hollanders, behold their diligence
in fishing and our own careless negligence.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another pamphlet, <cite>The Trades Increase</cite><a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>, was of
wider scope. It was directly inspired, as its anonymous
author J. R. informs us, by the reading of <cite>England's
Way to win Wealth</cite>. It deals not only with the question
of the fisheries, but of shipping and trade
generally, and rightly with shipping first of all. 'As
concerning ships,' J. R. writes&mdash;and how true do his
words ring in an Englishman's ears to-day&mdash;'by these
in a manner we live, the kingdom is, the King reigneth....
If we want ships, we are dissolved.' As Gentleman's
pamphlet is valuable for its detailed statistics of
the fishing industry of the Hollanders, even more so is
that of J. R. for its broad survey of and comparison
between the Dutch and English trade in every part of
the world. From country to country and sea to sea in
all branches of commerce he shows how the English
are being driven out by their more enterprising competitors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In consequence want of employment is breeding
discontents and miseries, while the means for remedying
threatened disaster are in our own hands, the place
our own seas and within his Majesty's dominions.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Nor is J. R. content with mere assertion. Basing his
arguments on those of Gentleman, he proceeds to set
forth how by the encouragement of English fishing</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'we shall repair our Navy, breed seamen abundantly,
enrich the subject, advance the King's custom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and assure the Kingdom, and all this out of fishing
and especially out of herrings.'</p></blockquote>

<p>As to the Hollanders, he remarks significantly:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Howsoever it pleaseth his Majesty to allow of his
royal predecessor's bounty, in tolerating the neighbour
nations to fish in his streams, yet other princes take
more straight courses.'</p></blockquote>

<p>This powerful and reasoned summary of a condition
of affairs so threatening to England's supremacy as
a maritime power, and to the welfare of her people,
testifies to the mixture of indignation and alarm with
which the English people regarded the rapid progress
in commerce and wealth of 'their neighbours the new
Sea-Herrs', as J. R. names the Dutch. If further
evidence were wanting as to the state of feeling in the
country, it is furnished by the striking language of the
Venetian envoy, Pietro Contarini (1617/18). According
to the report of this impartial observer<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Loud praises of past times and the worthy deeds of
forefathers form the topic of conversation. I have
heard great lords with tears of the deepest affliction
lamenting the present state of things and grieving how
England has already fallen in reputation with all the
world, England whose name and whose forces were
feared by foes and esteemed by friends. Now the
memory of past glory lost, as it were fallen into forgetfulness
of herself, she abandons not only the interests
of others, but even her own.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Such was the result of the forciful feeble policy of
James, striving to pose as the keeper of the peace of
Europe, and to hold the balance between the rival
forces of Catholicism and Protestantism already arming
for the terrible struggle of the Thirty Years' War. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the marriage of his only daughter with the head of the
Protestant Union in Germany, he was soon once more
in eager pursuit of the phantasmal Spanish match,
which was for so many years to make him follow
a vacillating policy. The skilful diplomacy of Diego
Sarmiento d'Acuña, Count of Gondomar, who represented
Philip III in London after 1613, enabled him
at this time to acquire a great ascendancy over James,
which with brief intervals he maintained for some years.
The Spanish envoy left no steps untried in the course
of the disputes which arose with the United Provinces
to prejudice the King's mind against the Dutch. He
found the moment peculiarly favourable for making
his influence felt, and he used his opportunities to the
utmost. It must be remembered that the year 1612,
in which first Robert Cecil, Lord Salisbury, died, and
then six months later Henry, Prince of Wales, a youth
of great promise and popularity, whose strong personality
must have impressed itself on the history of his
times, is a critical dividing point in the reign of James I.
Ranke has in his account of this period laid considerable
stress on this fact:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'In the first years of his reign in England', he writes,
'so long as Robert Cecil lived, King James exercised
no great influence. The Privy Council possessed to
the full the authority, which belonged to it of old custom.
James used simply to confirm the resolutions,
which were adopted in the bosom of the Council under
the influence of the treasurer. He appears in the
reports of ambassadors as a phantom King, and the
minister as the real ruler of the country. After the death
of Cecil all this was changed. The King knew the party
divisions which prevailed in the Council; he knew how
to hold the balance between them, and in the midst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
their divisions to carry out his views.... Great affairs
were generally transacted between the King and the
favourite in the ascendant at the time in conferences
to which only a few others were admitted, and sometimes
not even these. The King himself decided, and
the resolutions that were taken were communicated to
the Privy Council, which gradually became accustomed
to do nothing more than invest them with the customary
forms.'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It was at this very time, when King James, yielding
himself more and more to the persuasive blandishments
of Gondomar, began to take a more markedly personal
part in the direction of foreign policy, that a succession
of fresh difficulties with the Dutch arose. The execution
of the proclamation, which had been deferred for
two years in 1610, actually remained a dead letter until
1616. Not that there had been any removal of the
causes which had originally called it forth. On the
contrary, the first years of the truce were a period of
marked activity and vigorous forward policy in the
United Provinces. In every direction, through the
energetic and vigilant statesmanship of Oldenbarneveldt,
the commercial enterprise of the people was
enabled to open out fresh outlets for trade, and finally
to secure the recognition of the young Republic as an
influential member of the European family of nations.
Diplomatic missions were dispatched to Venice in 1609
and to Constantinople in 1612, which prepared the way
for a great extension of Dutch trade in the Eastern
Mediterranean. Even more important were the close
relations established with Sweden and Russia. Göteburg
became after 1609 virtually a Dutch town, and
before the middle of the century all Swedish industries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and Swedish commerce had passed more or less into
Dutch management or under Dutch control. In the
reign of Elizabeth the friendliest relations had subsisted
with the Tsar, Ivan the Terrible and his successors, so
that for some years the English Muscovy Company had
almost a monopoly of Russian trade by the White Sea.
But all this was now changed. A famous Dutch merchant,
Balthazar de Moncheron, established a factory
at Archangel in 1584, and from that time forward the
Dutch, at first vigorous competitors with the English
for the Russian market, gradually gained the supremacy.
The appearance of a Russian embassy at the Hague in
1614 was the mark of the triumph of Dutch diplomacy
at Moscow: henceforth Russia was practically closed
to all but Netherlanders. In 1615 a treaty with the
Hanse towns placed the Baltic trade even more completely
than it had been in Dutch hands. In the East
Indies the English Company could not compete with its
far wealthier and more thoroughly organized rival.</p>

<p>There was, however, one element of weakness in the
position of the United Provinces on which the English
were never weary of insisting. By his possession of
the cautionary towns the King of England appeared
in the eyes of the world to be recognized as a protector
of the Dutch Republic, who had certain rights
over it. Oldenbarneveldt in his negotiations had doubtless
been hampered by the plain evidence which the
presence of English garrisons in Flushing, Brill, and
Rammekens afforded, that the States did not exercise
full sovereign authority within their own borders. In
these circumstances he (Oldenbarneveldt) knowing full
well the financial straits to which King James was
reduced through the long-standing disagreement between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
him and his Parliament, made overtures in 1615
through the resident ambassador Caron to redeem the
towns by the payment of a sum of ready money. The
annual charge of £40,000 received from the States
was barely more than sufficient for the maintenance
of the garrisons. The total amount claimed by the
English Government was £600,000; the Dutch offered
£100,000 in cash, and three further sums of £50,000
in half-yearly instalments, or £250,000 in all. The
offer was accepted and in June, 1616, the cautionary
towns were transferred into the hands of the Dutch.</p>

<p>It was, however, agreed that, for the sake of maintaining
good relations between the two countries, the
new English ambassador, Sir Dudley Carleton, should
like his predecessor, Sir Ralph Winwood, retain his
seat in the Council of State. This was the more
important, as the King had (as already stated) for the
past three years been steadily moving towards a Spanish
alliance. What were his precise aims and what his
ultimate purpose it was difficult even for the practised
and penetrating insight of a statesman of Oldenbarneveldt's
experience to discover. Perhaps James scarcely
knew himself. But the retention of fortresses like
Flushing and Brill at the mouths of two most important
Dutch waterways by a foreign sovereign, who was
intriguing to win the favour of the Spanish foe, was for
the Republic a most serious danger. Their redemption
therefore at so trifling a cost was a stroke of policy by
which the aged Advocate did a great service to his
country. Certain it is that James felt a grudge against
Oldenbarneveldt, and that, when shortly afterwards
civil strife broke out in the United Provinces, Sir
D. Carleton, acting on the King's instructions, did his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
utmost to bring about the great statesman's downfall
and to support his enemies in compassing his death.</p>

<p>But to return. Sir Dudley Carleton, when entering
upon his duties at the Hague in January, 1616, found,
in addition to the negotiations for the 'reddition' of
the cautionary towns, several thorny questions requiring
delicate handling. In his instructions<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the following
somewhat enigmatical passage occurs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Some two years since there did arise between the
Company of our Muscovy Merchants and the Merchants
of Amsterdam a great difference concerning the navigation
of Greenland<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and the fishing of whales in those
parts. Our desire is that all good correspondence
may be maintained, as between our Crowns and their
Provinces, so between our and their subjects. Therefore,
whenever the subject shall fall into discourse,
either in public or in private, you may confidently
relate, when this question was debated before the lords
of the Council, between Sir Noel Caron their embassador
and the Governor of our Muscovian Company, it
was evidently proved, and in a manner without contradiction,
that our subjects were first discoverers of that
negotiation and that trade of fishing; that privately they
were possessed of that island, and there had planted and
erected our standard, thereby to signify and notify to the
world the property, which we challenge; which our subjects,
by their industries, having appropriated to themselves,
did not hold it reasonable they should be forced
to communicate to others the fruits of their labours.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The origin and cause of this new fishery dispute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
requires to be briefly told, as it is characteristic of the
times and of the way in which, in almost every part
of the world, the English trader and the Dutch trader
met in rivalry, and with the inevitable result that
their interests clashed and bad feeling arose. Certain
English fishing vessels as early as 1608 made their
way to the Arctic Ocean to fish for whales off the
shores of Spitzbergen. The adventure was successful,
and was repeated. The news of it attracted some
Biscayans, then other foreigners, and in 1612 two
Dutch ships to try their fortune in the same waters.
But King James in the following year (1613) granted
to the Muscovy Company an exclusive monopoly of
the Greenland, meaning thereby the Spitzbergen, whale
fishery. He claimed these northern waters as the
property of the British Crown, because, so it was
averred, Hugh Willoughby had in 1553 discovered
Spitzbergen. The conferring of this monopoly caused
in 1613 a numerous fishing fleet, some of the vessels
strongly armed, to set sail from England for Spitzbergen.
A landing was made, and the whole archipelago formally
annexed and named King James' Newland. The next
step of the Muscovy Company's fleet was to clear the
ground of intruders, whether foreigners or English
'interlopers.' Among the foreigners were several
Dutch boats. These were attacked, boarded, plundered,
and then sent home.</p>

<p>Such an act of violence naturally aroused resentment
in Holland. The States-General took the
matter up, and refused to admit the right of James
to interfere with the fishermen. They denied that
Hugh Willoughby had sighted Spitzbergen at all in
1553, and confidently affirmed that the discovery of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the island was made by Jacob van Heemskerk in 1596,
who named it Spitzbergen, planted the Dutch flag upon
it, and spent the winter on its shores. If, then, any
people had preferential rights in the waters surrounding
Spitzbergen, it was the Dutch, but the States did not
claim or admit any such rights. They held that the
sea was open to all to navigate and to fish in without
let or hindrance. To Winwood, who in August, 1613,
quitted the Hague to become Secretary of State in
London, was entrusted the mission of bringing the
complaints and the protest of the States to the notice
of James, and further, of asking for reparation to the
Amsterdammers, whose vessels had been seized and
plundered. The King at this time was anxious to be
on friendly terms with the Dutch, and an answer was
returned (October 25) that 'not only reparation should
be made, but that steps should be taken to prevent
a recurrence of such disorders.' The States were not
satisfied, however, with so general a reply, and wished
that the English claim to exclusive rights in the fisheries
should be abandoned. The ambassador Caron
was instructed to present to the King an argument
from the pen of the geographer Plancius, in which
this claim was shown to be without foundation. It
produced no effect upon James, always unwilling to
yield in a matter affecting his sovereign prerogatives,
however shadowy. But the States were equally
determined. Their reply to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">non-possumus</i> attitude
of the King was the granting of a charter, early in
1614 (January 27), to a company, generally known as
the Northern (sometimes as the Greenland) Company,
which conferred on a group of merchants the exclusive
privilege of fishing for whales and walrus, and of trading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and exploring in the Northern seas between the limits
of Nova Zembla and Davis's Straits; Spitzbergen, Bear
Island, and Greenland therein included.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The States-General
likewise consented that warships at the charges
of the company should be allowed to accompany the
fishing fleet for their protection (April 4). The effect
of these strong measures was seen in the changed
attitude of the Muscovy Company, who in the summer
of 1614 (July 2) made an agreement with their rivals,
that they should each of them use a portion of the
island as a basis for their fishery, and should unite in
keeping out all intruders. The extraordinary mission
of Sir Henry Wotton in February, 1615, to the Hague
to treat for a settlement of the Jülich-Cleves question,
gave an opportunity for proposing that he should,
while in the Netherlands, meet Commissioners of the
States to discuss also other important matters, and
among these the dispute about the so-called 'Greenland'
fisheries. In April the conference took place.
The Dutch, while laying stress upon their primary
rights as discoverers, disclaimed any desire to exclude
the English; on the contrary, they endeavoured to
arrive at a friendly arrangement by which the two
nations should share the fishery 'in unity and security'
together. Nothing, however, was effected. The language
of King James in his ambassador's instructions, in which
mention is made of the differences that had arisen 'on
account of the fishery in the North Sea, near the shores
of Greenland, of right solely belonging to us and our
people, but interrupted by the Hollanders', showed that
he approached the subject in an irreconcilable spirit.
All that Wotton could say was that he would report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the matter to the King, who would inform Caron later
of his decision. The affair was, in other words, hung
up, and the dangerous spectacle was again witnessed
of two fishing fleets carrying on their trade in close
proximity, each under the protection of warships.</p>

<p>The Dutch force in 1615 was, however, far stronger,
and no hostilities took place. For the same reason an
armed peace was maintained in 1617, but in the following
year acts of aggression were committed, and loud
complaints were raised on both sides. An attempt
was now made by the King to strengthen the hands of
the Muscovy Company by sanctioning for the purposes
of the whale fishery an alliance with the East India
Company. The two companies were, as far as regards
the Spitzbergen enterprise, to be regarded as one,
thus making a larger amount of capital available for
the outfit of the fishing fleet and for the maintenance
of the storage huts and so-called 'cookeries' on shore.
Thirteen well-equipped ships sailed for Spitzbergen in
1618, and an even superior number from Holland and
Zeeland, accompanied by two war vessels. Neither
the English nor the Dutch sailors were in the mood to
brook interference, and from the outset it was almost
certain that if they met there would be mischief. The
English were the first aggressors, but were in their
turn attacked by the Dutch with the result that their
fleet was dispersed and many of their vessels plundered.
The 'Greenland' fisheries question had reached an
acute stage. Such a condition of things could not continue,
and Sir Dudley Carleton, the English ambassador,
appeared in person before the States-General
(October 3, 1618) to utter a strong remonstrance and
to urge the States, if they wished to remain on good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
terms with the King, to dispatch a special embassy to
deal with the disputes that had arisen between the two
countries, not only concerning the 'Greenland' fishing,
but in the East Indies, and about the herring fishery
and the cloth trade also.</p>

<p>At this point, before giving an account of the embassy
of 1618, we must turn back and bring up to date
the history of the herring fishery question from 1610,
when the execution of the proclamation requiring
a licence from the fishermen was postponed, and also
briefly touch upon the two other causes of grievance in
regard to the cloth trade and the disputes between the
two East India Companies.</p>

<p>For several years after the return of the embassy of
1610 the Dutch herring fishery appears to have been
quietly carried on as usual without let or hindrance from
the English Government. No attempt was made to
enforce the proclamation until 1616. The cause of the
alteration of James's policy at that date was due to
the refusal of the States-General to admit English
dyed cloths into the United Provinces. The manufacture
of woollen cloth had long been the chief of English
industries, and the monopoly of the trade in wool and
woollen goods in the Netherlands, Northern France
and Western Germany had been in the hands of one
of the oldest of English Chartered Companies, the Fellowship
of Merchant Adventurers<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>, whose first charter
was granted by Henry VI in 1462. The Adventurer's
Court and Staple were for many years placed at
Antwerp. But in 1568 they were driven away from the
Netherlands by Alva, and forced to settle elsewhere.
They went first to Emden, then to Hamburg. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Hanse towns were jealous of their trade and prosperity,
and the Emperor was induced in 1597 to banish them
from Germany. At this date the authority of Spain
was no longer recognized north of the Scheldt. The
Adventurers accordingly in 1598 moved to Middelburg
in Zeeland, and extensive privileges were conferred
upon them by the States-General, the States of Zeeland,
and the town of Middelburg, including freedom from
duties on imports or exports, as well as from charges
for staple rights and harbour dues, and the right to be
tried in their own courts.</p>

<p>The trade of the Adventurers consisted entirely in
undyed cloths. The English, though the best weavers
of woollen cloth in the world, had not learnt as yet the
art of dyeing, and the unfinished cloths were imported
into the Netherlands, there to be dressed and dyed for
the continental markets. The consequence was that
a great industry sprang up in the provinces, especially
in Holland, and many thousands of skilled hands were
employed in this work.</p>

<p>When James I came to the throne, he listened
eagerly to every one who could point out to him any
means of raising money by the sale of monopolies or
patents. Among the proposals that attracted him was
one made by Alderman Sir William Cockayne, who
represented to his Majesty the great profit which might
be derived from finishing and dyeing English cloth
before exportation. The Merchant Adventurers
naturally used their utmost influence on the one hand
to persuade the King not to grant to Cockayne a patent,
which would be subversive of the rights granted to
their Company under their Charter, and on the other
to obtain the help of the States in preventing such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
a breach of existing privilege to the injury of the Dutch
dyers and finishers. The monopoly of the Adventurers
had, however, many enemies among the English
merchants who did not belong to the Fellowship, and
who already, under the name of 'Interlopers'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, carried
on an extensive illegitimate trade through the ports of
Amsterdam and Flushing. Cockayne and his adherents
prevailed. A patent was granted to him in 1608,
his Majesty reserving to himself the monopoly of the
sale of all home-dyed goods. It was clear, however,
that the existence of the two monopolies side by side
could not continue. After much friction and constant
complaints, James, in 1615, took decisive action. He
forbade the export of undyed and unfinished cloth from
England, and commanded the Merchant Adventurers
to return their Charter. Cockayne immediately formed
a company, but his hopes of creating a new and lucrative
English industry were speedily dashed to the
ground. The States of Holland passed a resolution
forbidding the importation of dyed cloths into their
province, and their example was followed by the other
provinces separately, and by the States-General. The
English woollen trade was stricken fatally by such
a prohibition, Cockayne's Company failed, and James
was at last compelled in 1617 to renew the Charter of
the Adventurers.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the King, who had hoped
to replenish his empty treasury through his active promotion
of Cockayne's scheme, was sorely disappointed
at the issue, and deeply resented the strong measures
taken by Holland and the United Provinces generally
to checkmate his plan for the creation of a new English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
industry to their injury. Baulked in this direction,
James, on his side, turned his thoughts to reprisals, and
in so doing had on this occasion the full approval of his
subjects. Secretary Winwood wrote, September 14,
1616, to Sir Dudley Carleton, at the Hague:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It is in the mouth of every true-hearted Englishman
that as a reprisal for the publication of the rigorous
placard against English dyed and dressed cloths, that
his Majesty with justice and equity and in reason of
state ought to forbid the Hollanders, by a fresh revival
of former proclamations, to continue their yearly fishing
on our coast.'</p></blockquote>

<p>But Winwood had had long personal knowledge of
the Dutch, and he did not like the prospect of the two
nations, so long and closely bound together by ties of
friendship and alliance, thus drifting apart through
trade rivalries into enmity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'If we come', he writes, 'to these extremities I know
both we and they shall suffer and smart for it'. And
then he continues in words rendered weighty by the
experience which lay behind them: 'I know well the
nature of that people and the humour of those masters,
who sit at the stern of that State. They will not
be willingly crossed in their courses&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et quod volunt,
valde volunt</i>. Yet it is never too late to be wise, and
no counsel is evil but that which cannot be changed.
I profess unto you I am in great anguish of spirit, how
to accommodate these differences to the full contentment
of all parties. This is most certain&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">couste que
couste</i>&mdash;and though <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coelum terris misceatur</i>, his Majesty
is resolved not to swallow, much less to digest, these
indignities. As before I have said, only the Spaniards
have cause to triumph and to make bonfires of joy and
gladness.' He requests Carleton to see Oldenbarneveldt
and urge accommodation for the mutual good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
both countries. 'If the States', he adds, 'do persist in
their resolutions, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">actum est de amicitia</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But although Winwood speaks in this letter, dated
September 24, as if the King was only considering the
question of a revival of the proclamation of 1609, steps
had already been taken (apparently with his knowledge)
to levy a toll upon the fishers on the Scottish
coast. As early as June 16, the Duke of Lennox, in
his capacity as Admiral of Scotland, had received
instructions from the Scottish Council to take from
every fishing 'buss' a payment either in money (an
angelot) or in kind (one ton of herring and twelve codfish).
Accordingly, on August 7, a vessel appeared in
the midst of the fishing fleet, having on board a certain
John Browne, the Duke's Secretary. The Dutch envoy
(Caron) had been induced, under a misconception
of the purpose for which it was required, to write a
commendatory letter for this man to show to the captains
of the Dutch convoy-ships. Browne demanded
in the name of the King from the skippers of each
'buss' the above-named toll or excise, and he proceeded
to make a list of all their names and the names
of the boats, giving receipts to those who paid, and
informing those who did not do so that they would
have to pay double the following year. The greater
part paid without opposition, until the two convoy-ships
arrived on the scene. Browne was seized and
requested to produce his commission. At the sight of
Caron's letter, however, they dismissed him, as he had
used no violence, but they would not allow him to
collect any more toll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The two captains, as in duty bound, reported the
matter at once to the home authorities. Great was
the surprise and indignation at Enkhuysen and other
centres of the fishing industry at the reception of the
news. On August 27 it was discussed by the States-General,
who denounced the attempt to levy a toll as
'an unheard-of and unendurable novelty, conflicting
with previous treaties'. Two dispatches were sent,
one to Caron telling him 'that the States had taken
the matter extremely to heart, and desired him to seek
for redress by every possible means'; the other to the
captains of the convoy bidding them 'not to permit
any toll to be exacted'. In obedience to his instructions
Caron made repeated representations to the
King, to Lennox, to the Scottish Council, but his arguments
and remonstrances fell on deaf ears, and his
efforts to obtain satisfaction proved fruitless. In these
circumstances the opening of the fishing season of 1617
was awaited in Holland with anxiety, and by those
acquainted with the temper of the Dutch seamen, with
apprehension. Their fears were justified.</p>

<p>Browne again visited the fishing fleet, and began his
task of levying toll, which according to all testimony
he carried out in a tactful and considerate manner.
Arriving at the Rotterdam convoy-ship he met with
a flat refusal from the captain, Andries Tlieff of
Rotterdam, in his own name and that of the other
Dutch fishermen. After having received this refusal
in writing, Browne was preparing quietly to go away
to visit the other fishing boats, mostly French, when
Jan Albertsz, captain of the Enkhuysen convoy-ship,
stepped on board. He was one of the two captains
who had in the previous year forcibly compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Browne to stop his collection of toll. Albertsz now
declared that he had orders to arrest Browne, and,
despite his protests, the Scottish official was made
a prisoner and carried to Holland.</p>

<p>The indignation of James, when he heard of what
had taken place, knew no bounds. Two captains of
Dutch vessels in the Thames were seized, as hostages,
and Carleton was instructed to go in person to the
States-General and demand satisfaction for the insult
and injury done to his Majesty's honour by the 'exemplary
punishment and in a public and open fashion of
those, who had committed such an act: a satisfaction
such as may hold a just proportion unto the insolency
of the grievance.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> On August 23, Carleton, describing
the result of an interview with the Advocate, spoke of
'Barneveldt not knowing what to say, but that the
taking of Browne was ill-done, and desiring me with
his hat in his hand (much differing from his use) to
make report thereof to his Majesty.' Both he and
also Maurice disavowed Albertsz's action, and the
States-General in their turn declared that the captains
had acted without instructions, and ordered Browne
to be released. At the same time they respectfully
insisted that their fishermen were specially exempted
from paying any toll for their fishing. They ask
Carleton to beg James, as Browne had been set free,
to release the hostages that he had seized. But
Winwood peremptorily informed Carleton (August 27,
O.S.), 'His Majesty will take no satisfaction, but to
have the captains and chief officers of the ships sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
over prisoners to England.' This demand, however,
was most unpalatable in Holland. The States of that
province stood upon their privileges. The captains
should be tried, they said, but only by their own courts
and laws. James, however, would not give way. In
Winwood's words 'he insisted, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fort et ferme</i>, on the
offenders being delivered into his hands'. Thus for
many months the obstinate dispute continued. At last
(February 1) the States of Holland, the opposition of
the towns of Rotterdam and Enkhuysen to deliver up
their citizens having been overcome, consented that
Albertsz and Tlieff should be sent to Noel Caron to
submit themselves to his Majesty's mercy, 'for which,'
says Carleton,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> 'in a letter they sue, and' he adds
'they also ask for the freedom of fishing on the coast
of Scotland, to which they lay claim, without molestation.'
Not till April did Tlieff actually set sail for
England, and then without the worse offender, Albertsz,
who was very ill, and in fact died shortly afterwards.
James now, however, professed himself satisfied,
the hostages were set free, and the Browne incident
closed without a breach of the peace.</p>

<p>The fishery dispute meanwhile remained an open
sore. Loud complaints were made by the Scottish
Council that the Dutch not only claimed the right to
fish free from any toll, but they under the protection of
their armed convoy hindered the Scottish boats from
fishing, and took away their nets and otherwise treated
them 'with daily outrages and insolences'. This was
the state of affairs in 1617. Carleton made many and
strong remonstrances, but in 1618 the complaints of
the Scotch that they were driven away from the fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
grounds by acts of violence were louder than ever.
Instructions had been given to Carleton (April 10,
1618) that, as a means for avoiding these disputes and
encounters, he should request the States to order their
fishermen to ply their trade out of sight of land, as
had been, so he averred, their former custom. After
a delay of two months the States, while promising to
punish severely all who could be shown to have committed
such acts as those complained of, declared that
after examination of witnesses on oath they could not
discover that any offences such as those spoken of by
the King had taken place. As to the Netherlanders
fishing out of sight of land, they denied any knowledge
of such a custom, and prayed the King not to disturb
their countrymen in the exercise of that right of free
fishing granted them from time immemorial by a succession
of treaties.</p>

<p>Thus in the summer of 1618 we have seen that no
less than three burning questions&mdash;the Greenland or
Spitzbergen fishery, the Great or Herring fishery, and
the refusal to admit English dyed or dressed cloths
into the Netherlands&mdash;were causing the relations
between England and the United Provinces to be
very strained. A fourth question, that of the disputes
of the rival East India Companies as to trading rights
in the Banda Islands, Amboyna, and the Moluccas,
where the Dutch, being in far stronger force, prevented
the English from sharing in the lucrative commerce in
spices, was also becoming acute. Several islands&mdash;among
them one named Pulo Run, which the English,
by the consent of the natives, had occupied&mdash;were
seized by the Dutch, and actual hostilities between
the fleets representing the two nations in those waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
were only avoided because the English were not in
a position to offer effective resistance to their superior
adversaries. Negotiations had therefore been set on
foot as early as 1615 to effect a friendly understanding
by which the English should be allowed a fair share in
the spice trade, and the companies co-operate for their
common interest. So far, however, in 1618, were
matters from being arranged, that a strong fleet had
been dispatched from London in that year under Sir
Thomas Dale to restore the balance of power in the
Bunda archipelago.</p>

<p>When, therefore, as has been already related,
Carleton on October 3 appeared in the States-General
to protest in the strongest possible language against
the acts of hostility committed against the fishing fleet
of the Muscovy Company off Spitzbergen, he did not
confine himself to this one cause of embittered dispute,
but demanded that the States should send at once,
promptly and without delay, the special embassy, which
had been often spoken of but never taken seriously in
hand, to discuss in London all the points of difference
between the two nations&mdash;the East Indian spice trade,
the herring fishery, and the dyed cloth question&mdash;and
to strive to arrive at a friendly arrangement. Otherwise,
he warned them that the King, though he had shown
himself willing to bear much at their hands, had now
reached the limit of his endurance.</p>

<h2>III: 1618-1623</h2>


<p>In the Netherlands the minds of all men were
throughout the year 1618 preoccupied with the fierce
political and religious discords that had brought civil
strife into the land. The sword of Maurice had, in the
name of the States-General of the Union, overthrown
the power of the provincial oligarchies, and despite the
strenuous opposition of the States of Holland under
the leadership of Oldenbarneveldt, had made good the
claim of the States-General to sovereign authority in
the Republic. The aged Advocate of Holland, so long
supreme in the administration of public affairs, with his
chief adherents, lay in prison awaiting trial and condemnation.
Anxious, therefore, at such a crisis, to
avoid a breach with King James, or to provoke on his
part measures of reprisal (especially in view of the
approaching meeting of the Synod of Dort, at which
James was to be officially represented), the States
announced their readiness (October 18) to accede to
Carleton's request for the speedy dispatch of a special
embassy. But they wished to confine the subjects of
discussion to the East Indian and Greenland disputes.
In vain Carleton pressed upon the States the urgency
of including the Great (Herring) Fishery and dyed
cloth questions in the instruction. The reply was that
it would be dangerous in the disturbed condition of the
country to touch matters of such great importance
affecting the interests of so large a portion of the
population of the maritime provinces. A clear indication
was moreover given that on these two points there
was little possibility of concession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The ambassadors arrived in England (December 7)
accompanied by five commissioners of the East India
Company. The King received them with expressions
of friendliness (December 20), but the examination of
their instructions by the Privy Council at once revealed
that the subject of the Great Fisheries, which had
most interest for the English, was omitted. The Dutch
envoys accordingly were informed that the King was
very astonished that the warnings of Carleton had been
without effect, and that their mission would be fruitless
unless this point, which concerned the King's sovereign
rights, were placed in the forefront of the negotiations.
James, indeed, refused to proceed unless the instructions
were altered, and held out the threat of an alliance
with Spain if his wishes were not complied with.
Carleton, indeed, in a long and angry representation
made to the States-General, January 12, 1619, practically
demanded, not only that the ambassadors should be
instructed to deal with the Great Fishery question, but
to admit that their rights under ancient treaties and
their contention as to the freedom of the sea were
claims that could not be sustained in face of the King's
'lawful title and exclusive sovereign rights and property
in the fisheries upon the coasts of his three kingdoms'.
In case of delay, England would maintain her rights
with the armed hand. The King was resolved that
the grievances of which his subjects complained must
cease.</p>

<p>The States-General, however, dared not in the midst
of the crisis through which the country was passing,
interfere with the fishery question. Maurice, as Captain-General
of the Union, had by military force overpowered
the resistance of the Province of Holland to the will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the States-General. Its leaders had been incarcerated,
and the town magistracies throughout Holland changed.
Feelings were very embittered, and the position of the
new magistrates would have been seriously endangered
had the dominant party consented to yield to English
threats the rights of free fishing, an industry on which
some 50,000 persons in Holland depended for their
livelihood. Both Maurice and his cousin and trusted
adviser, William Lewis of Nassau, Stadholder of Friesland,
were agreed that such a course was at the moment
unwise, if not impracticable. These considerations
were laid before James, who had throughout the discussions
in the Republic strongly sympathized with
the triumphant Contra-Remonstrant party. The result
was a modification in his unbending attitude. The King
agreed to defer the discussion of the 'Great Fishery'
question until the internal state of the Netherlands
had become more settled, and to proceed with the
Greenland fishery and East Indian matters first, on
condition that the delay was to be as short as possible
and not to extend beyond the end of the year. Indeed,
September 1 was named as the actual limit of time.
The States were quickly informed (January 21) of the
English concession, and now that the tension was
relieved, took more than three weeks in which to
consider carefully the terms of their answer to Carleton.
They were in a difficult position, and they finally
(February 13) gave in general terms a non-committal
undertaking that 'so soon as the affairs of this land,
political and religious, shall be brought into a better
state&mdash;if possible within a year', they will send ambassadors
to treat of the Great Fishery, the cloth trade,
and other points, as a preliminary to the revision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the treaties of intercourse. Meanwhile they trusted
that all should go on as before, and that the English
would make no innovation in contravention of the
ancient customs and treaties. So the matter rested,
the States being warned that the King demanded that
the placard of June 5, 1618, forbidding the Dutch
fishermen to commit further outrages and excesses
'on pain of severe penalties', or to approach within
sight (the English said within 14 miles, but to this the
Dutch objected) of the Scottish coast, should be rigidly
enforced during the intermediate period of delay.</p>

<p>The efforts of the Dutch ambassadors to settle the
two questions which according to their instructions
were the chief object of their mission nevertheless
encountered serious difficulties, and it was soon apparent
that the views of the two parties were almost
irreconcilable. The scheme for a working union of
the two East India Companies was speedily given
up. For months, however, the rights and wrongs of
the two nations with regard to the Greenland (Spitzbergen)
fisheries were the subject of many conferences
and interchanges of notes. The English maintained
that they, on the ground of first discovery and of being
the first to fish in the Spitzbergen waters, had exclusive
rights of sovereignty both on the land and the
seas that surrounded it. The Dutch set up the counter-claim
that they had not only first discovered, but first
occupied the land, and they held firmly that the sea
was free to all nations. For the damages suffered by
the English fishing fleet at the hands of the Netherlanders
in 1618 an indemnity was demanded by the
English Government amounting to £43,800, and this
did not include the amounts due to private ship-owners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
for the loss of their trade, and to the relatives of those
who had been killed or wounded. The Dutch replied
by pointing to the repeated provocations the Hollanders
and Zeelanders had had year by year to endure, and
to the losses they on their side had suffered not only
through being hindered in their fishing, but through
actual plundering of their goods. The ambassadors
promised to give reparation, if the English would do
the same. Tired at last of fruitless discussions, prolonged
month after month, the Dutch envoys sought
a personal interview with the King, July 10, at Greenwich,
to see if any <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> could be arrived at.
All the old arguments on both sides were repeated,
and neither would yield on the point of their several
'rights'; the utmost the King would concede was
a suggestion that, as a favour, he might connive at the
Netherlanders fishing in his waters. This did not
satisfy the ambassadors, and they fell back on the
familiar device of asking that the question should be
put off for later settlement. To this finally James
agreed, and it was arranged that the matter should
be deferred for further negotiations for a period of
three years, and that meanwhile the English and Dutch
were to fish peaceably together. The King insisted
that restitution should be made for the damage done
by the armed attack on the English fleet in 1618
within three months, and for all other losses inflicted
by the Dutch within the three years. As soon as
the full English claims were settled (such was the
ultimatum), the question of the satisfaction due to the
Netherlanders should be considered. With this decision,
however unpalatable to them, the envoys had
perforce to be content. They sailed from Gravesend,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
on August 1, without having really effected anything
but a postponement of disputes, which mere delay
was more likely to aggravate than to appease.</p>

<p>The results then of the embassy of 1618 were disappointing
to both parties. The English resented the
continued presence of the Dutch fishermen both in
the home waters and in the Northern Seas, for they
not only carried off the profits from what were regarded
as British industries, but behaved with overbearing
arrogance as if in their own domain. The Hollanders
found themselves permitted, as it were on sufferance, to
continue an occupation which supplied a large part of
their population with sustenance and was the basis of
their prosperity. The States-General, though they were
committed by their envoys to send a fresh embassy to
deal with the question of the Great Fisheries, as soon
as the internal troubles of the country were settled, were
in no hurry to move in the matter. It was in vain that
Carleton in the early months of 1620 reminded them of
their undertaking. The general opinion in Holland, and
in this Prince Maurice himself shared, was that there
could be no surrender of the treaty right to free fishing,
even though it should be at the cost of war.</p>

<p>Their position was greatly strengthened by the momentous
events that had been occurring in Germany.
The Elector Palatine, Frederick&mdash;King James's son-in-law&mdash;had
accepted the Crown of Bohemia (November,
1619) but a year later his forces were crushed by the
Imperial army at the White Hill near Prague (November
5). Meanwhile his hereditary dominions had been
invaded and conquered by a Spanish force under Spinola.
Frederick was head of the Protestant Union, but the
forces of the Union were disunited (indeed it was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
afterwards dissolved), and although Sir Horace Vere,
at the head of a fine body of 2,000 English volunteers,
escorted by a strong Dutch force, made his way to the
scene of conflict, he was unable to prevent the Spanish
conquest of the Lower Palatinate. The unfortunate
King of Bohemia, a homeless fugitive, was compelled
with his wife, Elizabeth of England, to seek refuge
with his uncle, the Prince of Orange, at the Hague.
The Dutch were greatly disturbed, as the twelve years'
truce was drawing to an end, at the prospect of the
Spaniards being able through their alliance with the
Emperor to march from their post of vantage on
the Rhine straight upon the Netherlands, and were
therefore anxious to secure the goodwill and help of
England in the serious struggle which they saw before
them. They felt confident that, despite his love of
peace, James would be forced to take active steps to
defend his son-in-law's lands from conquest, and the
cause of Protestantism in Germany from ruin. The
news of the complete defeat of Frederick at the White
Hill therefore, together with the necessity of renewing
the treaty between the two countries, which expired in
April, 1621, at the end of the truce, had more effect
than Carleton's remonstrances and threats in hastening
a renewal of negotiations. The English ambassador
was instructed to assure the States that James would
lend assistance for the recovery of the Palatinate, and
it was resolved by them that a special mission should
be dispatched as soon as possible. It was well known
that the King was still on the most confidential terms
with Gondomar, and that the Spanish envoy continued
to exercise a strong influence upon the royal policy,
and that the project of a Spanish marriage had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
been abandoned. It was felt therefore that a strong
effort should be made to counteract this secret leaning
of James to listen to the subtle counsels of the Spaniard,
and to persuade him to break with Spain and to take
decisively the Protestant side in the war against the
allied forces of the House of Habsburg.</p>

<p>The ambassadors set sail from Veere, January 28,
1621, and arrived in London on February 1. They
were six in number, representing the three maritime
provinces of Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland, in itself
a proof that though the affairs of the Palatinate were
the principal subject that filled their instructions, the
fishery questions, for the moment placed in the background,
had in reality lost none of their importance.
The names of the special envoys were Jonkheer Jacobus
van Wijngaerden, Johan Camerling, Albert Sonck,
Albert Bruyninck, Jacobus Schotte, and Jonkheer Frederik
van Vervou tot Martenahuys, and with them was
associated the resident in London, Noel Caron. At
their first audience with the King (February 7) the
situation in Germany was almost exclusively referred
to. They laid stress upon the extent of the Spanish
conquests on the Rhine, and after pointing out that
the States had been paying monthly subsidies to certain
of the Protestant princes and had collected a great
army on the frontier, expressed their gratification at the
information that had been received through Sir Dudley
Carleton to the effect that the King would, if diplomacy
failed, restore his children in the possessions by force.
Should he indeed be prepared to take steps for military
intervention, they were commissioned to assure him
that the States would be ready to second his action
and to go to war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The embassy had arrived at a critical moment in the
reign of James I, and after some words of friendly compliment
their conference with the Privy Council was
deferred until February 15. In the interval James's
third Parliament had met (February 9). The King's
financial necessities had forced him to summon a Parliament,
and the session was to prove a very stormy
one. The leaders of the Commons at once demanded
the redress of many grievances and proceeded to attack
those whom they charged with being the cause of the
abuses they denounced, more especially the omnipotent
favourite, Buckingham himself. The sojourn of the
Dutch mission therefore coincided with a period of
political stress and anxiety. But the envoys had the
satisfaction of knowing that the English Parliament,
which in this was thoroughly representative of public
opinion in the country, was enthusiastically in favour of
active support being given to the King of Bohemia for
the recovery of the Palatinate. Subsidies were without
delay voted for that purpose, and the vote was accompanied
by a petition urging the King to make war with
Spain and to break off the negotiations for the Spanish
marriage.</p>

<p>But Gondomar found no difficulty in trading upon
James's habitual preference for peaceful methods. According
to the testimony of the Venetian, Girolamo
Lando, the Spanish ambassador 'had access to the
King at any hour, and found all doors open to him
which were accustomed to be shut to others', and he is
described as 'with ever-increasing boldness carrying on
a campaign against these kingdoms with unspeakable
intrigues and corruption.' Through his counsels the
King entered upon a series of negotiations with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Courts of Madrid and Vienna in the interests of Frederick,
which were perfectly futile and merely afforded
the Catholic powers time to strengthen their position
upon the Rhine. At the same time James, by opposing
himself to the expressed wishes of his Parliament and
people in this matter of the Palatinate, only heightened
the determination of the House of Commons to assert
their privileges and insist upon their demand for a redress
of grievances. In foreign no less than in domestic
affairs, the views of the King and those of the representatives
of his people proved to be diametrically opposed.
In December accordingly, no compromise being possible,
Parliament was dissolved, and James, left in
desperate financial straits, was unable to carry out any
policy that involved expenditure. In considering the
course of the negotiations with the Dutch, these facts
must be borne in mind, for they are vitally important
for a right understanding of the situation.</p>

<p>The embassy, delayed by the opening of Parliament,
had a conference with the Privy Council on February 15.
Once more they impressed upon their audience the
seriousness of the dangers which threatened both the
United Provinces and England from the war in Germany,
and urged, now that the truce with Spain was
almost expired, the renewal of the treaty of alliance
between the two countries to defend the Protestant
cause against a common enemy. In the words of the
contemporary historian Aitzema, 'they laid strong
emphasis upon this last point as if it were the only
object and aim of the embassy.' But the Council had
no desire, so immediately after the meeting of Parliament,
to commit themselves on the subject of military
intervention, for they were well aware of the King's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
disinclination to break with Spain. The question
was accordingly put to the Dutchmen as to whether
there were no other points in their instructions, mention
being specially made of the fisheries, the cloth,
and the East Indian disputes. The reply was that
in the present critical condition of European affairs
the interest of both States required that secondary
questions should be allowed to rest and continue on
the same footing as before in the presence of the
grave danger (now the truce was drawing to an end)
from a mighty enemy. Some lesser differences which
had arisen about the 'tare' in the cloth trade, and
the 'mint', they were ready to discuss, but nothing
more.</p>

<p>The matter was referred to the King, and on
March 2 the envoys had a second conference with the
Council, when it was made clear to them that the
fisheries questions must be settled as a preliminary to
any treaty of alliance. The Dutch could only answer
(March 10) that they had received no powers to negotiate
upon the fisheries, but in accordance with their
instructions they pointed out the difficulty and the
danger of trying to interfere with an industry in which
so large a part of the population were interested, while
civil discords were scarcely appeased and a renewal of
the war with Spain was on the point of breaking out.
So much was this the case that though the value of the
fishing (so they said) was steadily decreasing, the States
were granting large subsidies for convoys in order to
provide the means of sustenance for so large a number
of their subjects. The smallest toll or charge, they
argued, would either cause 'their fishery to be entirely
destroyed and ruined, or possibly stir up this rude sea-faring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
population to fresh commotions to the manifest
peril of the repose of the Republic, scarcely cured of the
wounds of its late infirmity.' They begged therefore
that the consideration of the matter might be put off
to a more fitting time, and meanwhile that the old
privileges should continue in force. As to the Greenland
fishery, it was pleaded that the three years' delay
that had been granted in 1619 was not yet expired.
Similarly in the East Indian disputes, which continued
with no less frequency and bitterness, although an
accord between the two companies had been agreed
upon in June, 1619, the Netherlanders met the complaints
of the representatives of the English Company
with excuses and counter-protests. There was much
talking, but practically no progress made. After several
interviews with the Council and the King himself it
was finally arranged that things should remain as they
were for a short time longer, but the King insisted
(April 8) that 'the fishery questions concerned his
right and his honour and that he could not allow them
to be any longer in debate and suspense', and that
a special Commission must be sent by the States to
deal with these disputes, and further, that he would
not wait longer than May 31. He also demanded
a settlement of the quarrels in the East Indies, and
a withdrawal of the 'tare' edict, which was declared
to be the ruin of the cloth industry in England. So
soon as these matters were satisfactorily arranged, he
promised that he would conclude an alliance with the
States. The Dutch envoys left London on their return
journey on April 26.</p>

<p>As a proof of the very close relations subsisting at
this time between England and the United Provinces,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it may be mentioned that in the very same months
that the Wijngaerden embassy was thus holding ineffectual
conferences in London with the King of
England and his Privy Council, the Fellowship of the
Merchant Adventurers were transferring their Court to
the Prinsenhof at Delft.</p>

<p>Driven from Antwerp in 1582 the Adventurers had,
as already related, set up their Great Court first at
Emden, then at Hamburg and Stade. But in 1598
the enmity of the Hanse towns compelled them to
leave Stade, and to establish themselves at Middelburg
in Zeeland. Until the suppression of the Adventurers'
Charter in 1615, this town was the staple for English
cloth and wool in the Netherlands, though the 'interlopers'
as they were called, succeeded in carrying on
an active smuggling trade through Amsterdam and
Flushing. After the renewal of the Charter in 1617
the Adventurers returned to Middelburg, but on account
of the unhealthiness of the place, and other
reasons, they determined to remove to Delft. To
effect this involved elaborate negotiations with the
Town Corporation, with the States of Holland, and
with the States-General. Moreover, the consent of the
King was necessary as a preliminary step. Sir Dudley
Carleton was largely instrumental in bringing the matter
to a successful issue. James gave his consent that
the Court should move from Zeeland within the
borders of Holland, 'to show his Majesty's great affection
for that Province'. On April 21, 1621, the contract
with Delft was signed, just as the Dutch envoys
were leaving England. But Amsterdam, with whose
cloth merchants the 'interlopers' had been engaged in
a profitable trade, sent in to the States of Holland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
a very strongly worded remonstrance. They objected
to the privileges which the Delft Corporation had
granted to the Adventurers as injurious to themselves
and the interests of the province. The States of
Holland on receiving this remonstrance resolved that
the contract made by Delft and the monopoly of the
Adventurers should be examined by a commission.
Against this Delft and a number of other towns sent
in a counter-remonstrance, but the influence of Amsterdam
outweighed theirs in the provincial States, who
by a majority of votes persisted in their determination.
The Merchant Adventurers, however, appealed from
the provincial authorities to the States-General, who
had always been their protectors. And now began
one of those curious struggles so common in Dutch
history between the town of Delft, the States of
Holland, and the States-General, all of them claiming
independent authority to deal with the matter. The
Corporation of Delft refused to hand over their contract
with the Merchant Adventurers to be examined
by the Commission of the States of Holland. At last,
however, it was agreed by both parties that it should
be placed in the hands of Prince Maurice and some
impartial persons, who should then confer with the
States, and draw 'a good regulation for the preserving
of the common industries'. Maurice appointed a commission
on which the ten towns interested in the cloth
trade (of which naturally Delft was one) were represented,
to take the matter in hand, and on June 19,
1621, the 'Regulation' was drawn up which defined
the privileges and conditions under which the Adventurers
henceforth for many years carried on their trade
in Holland. Its terms therefore deserve to be briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
indicated. The old privileges giving freedom from
import and export duties, harbour and market tolls,
&amp;c., originally granted in 1598, were not revoked, but
defined afresh and modified. Art. i gave the Fellowship
permission to have their Court at Delft, but only
with the licences 'which we [the States of Holland] and
the States-General shall be pleased to accord, in trust
that the Netherlanders shall enjoy their old privileges
in England.' This last clause clearly referred to the
fishing rights, with which at that very moment the
English Government were proposing to interfere.
Art. ii reminded the Adventurers that when residing
in Holland 'they would be subject to all our edicts
and enactments made or still to make.' Art. iii dealt
with the excise recently imposed on foreign woollen
cloth. On this no concession was made; it must be
promptly paid. Art. iv insisted on the strict carrying
out of the edict of 1614 forbidding the importation of
dyed or prepared cloth, and also of the edict on the
'tare', which had been renewed in 1617. Both these
edicts were regarded as grievances by the English,
and had in 1618 and in 1621 been among the subjects
on which negotiations had proved fruitless.</p>

<p>Before this 'Regulation' of June 19, 1621, had come
into force the time fixed by King James for the
dispatch of another embassy to settle all outstanding
disputes had passed by. Through the representations
of Carleton at the Hague, and the letters of their own
ambassador Caron from London, it was made clear,
however, to the States that a temporizing policy was
no longer possible. Indefinite delay would not be
brooked. Steps were accordingly taken to approach
certain of those who claimed damages against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Greenland Company with an offer to compound with
them by a cash payment. Nor did the States confine
themselves to words, but gave practical proof of their
desire for peace, for when the Greenland Company
applied for a convoy of warships to accompany the
whale-fishing fleet to Spitzbergen, the States-General,
after consultation with the States of Holland, declined
to grant the request, April 28. The determined attitude
of Carleton, who threatened reprisals in the
Channel upon the ships returning from the East Indies
had its effect, and the slow-moving Netherlanders were
at last stirred to action. The new envoys were appointed
early in October, and though even after their
nomination there was further delay while the instructions
were being drawn up, within two months all
preliminaries were completed, and the embassy finally
arrived in London, December 8, 1621.</p>

<p>Its arrival coincided with the final rupture between
James and his Parliament, and the situation was far
from favourable to a really friendly settlement. The
King was in bad health, worried and embittered in
temper by the affronts which he had just been enduring
from what he regarded as the insolent demands of
a House of Commons which neither by threats nor by
persuasion had he been able to bend to his will. Both
Philip III of Spain and the Archduke Albert of the
Netherlands had recently died. A young king reigned
in Madrid, but his favourite, the Count of Olivares,
held the reins of power, a man filled with the ambition
of raising Spain once again to her old position of
ascendancy in Europe. His policy, as stated in the
Cortes of Castile, was to assist the Emperor to crush
the Protestant cause in Bohemia and in Germany, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
attack the Dutch rebels now that the truce was expired,
and to defend with all the power of the monarchy 'the
sacred Catholic faith and the authority of the Holy
See'. Yet in spite of so clear a declaration James fell
more and more under the spell exercised over him by
Gondomar, who had Buckingham and other English
councillors in his pay, and who continued to dangle
before the eyes of the infatuated King, still dreaming
of a Spanish match for his son, the hope that by the
friendly intervention of Philip IV at Vienna, he might
be able to secure without hostilities good terms for his
son-in-law, and a settlement of the Dutch and other
questions in a manner satisfactory to all parties. It
was, of course, a purely visionary project, nevertheless
it is probable that James was sincere in his aims, and
thought that he was acting nobly in playing the part of
arbiter of peace and war. But he was really a puppet
in the hands of those who were far more astute than
himself, and who, while he was negotiating, were
grimly preparing for the prosecution in real earnest of
the longest and most cruel war Europe has ever seen.
It was well known moreover to the statesmen, who
treated him as their dupe, that the breach between
James and his Parliament effectually prevented him,
even if he wished it, from serious intervention.</p>

<p>The Dutch Embassy, which was accompanied by
three Commissioners on behalf of the East India
Company, had at its head Francis van Aerssen, Lord of
Sommelsdijk. Aerssen, already distinguished as a
diplomatist and noted for the prominent part he had
taken in the recent overthrow of Oldenbarneveldt, was
for many years to be the trusted councillor of the
Stadholders Maurice and Frederick Henry. Richelieu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
at a later time, spoke of him as one of the three ablest
statesmen of his time. He had now before him a long
and difficult task. Aitzema lays special emphasis on
the duration and the expense of this special mission.
It lasted, he tells us, 454 days, and cost 80,850 guilders.
'In the course of it', he further remarks, 'King James
at the audiences made very particular and most remarkable
discourses, which were replied to by the Lord of
Sommelsdijk with exceptional prudence, he being a man
of great sharp-sightedness, eloquence, and experience.'</p>

<p>The skill of Aerssen is shown in the instructions for
the embassy, which, once more according to Aitzema,
were drawn up by himself. The following are the
important points. Art. vii deals with the 'questions
which have arisen on the whale fishery between the
English nation and the Greenland Company of their
lands and their differences concerning the pretended
losses suffered on either side.' The envoys are instructed,
if possible, to come to a friendly understanding,
'if not, by authoritative decision to draw up for the
future a Regulation of the aforesaid fishery' on the
lines of the previous negotiations, but 'not so as to
cause any disadvantage to the land's service or to
the rights of the privileged company,' Above all,
nothing is to be concluded on this matter without
awaiting the orders of the States-General, should time
and opportunity permit. The next five articles treat
of the affairs of the two East India Companies, which
were, in fact, the main object of the mission. The cloth
trade disputes are next dealt with. If complaints should
be made about the raising by the States of Holland of
the duty on foreign woollen goods, the lines of defence
are laid down in Arts. xiv and xv. In Art. xvi the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
envoys are bidden to avoid any reopening of the 'tare'
question, but should the placard enforcing an examination
of the goods by the tare-masters be denounced,
it must be shown to be necessary in the interests of the
cloth trade, and for the prevention of fraud. If English
subjects pretend to suffer any injury through the 'tare',
let them bring their grievances before their High
Mightinesses, who will see that justice is done.
Likewise on the subject of the 'interlopers' (Art. xvii)
silence is enjoined. The reply, however, to any complaint
is that his Majesty has the remedy in his own
hands by forbidding the 'interlopers' to trade. It
would be far easier to prevent their egress from
England than their ingress into the United Provinces.
Art. xviii deals with the question of the Mint. Last
of all, the instructions arrive at the Great Fisheries
difficulty. The envoys are carefully to avoid any
reference to this matter. If compelled to speak about
it, they are to say that they have received no instructions
thereon,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'as their High Mightinesses had hoped that the
King would leave this matter untouched, as His Majesty
had thought good to delay this whole question for a
further period still and a more fitting season. In any
case this industry is necessary for the subsistence of
many thousands of the sea-faring folk of their Lands,
and to consent to a course that would ruin them is
<em>impossible</em>, and there is no hope that such consent
would be given either now or hereafter.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Conferences were held with the Privy Council on
January 15, February 17, and March 14, the Dutch
trying to concentrate attention on the East Indian
differences, about which public opinion in England as
well as in Holland had been much stirred, and about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the renewal of the treaty of alliance, urging that the
King should take sides with his old allies against the
Spaniards and active steps to recover the Palatinate
for his son-in-law. Buckingham's efforts to discuss the
alleged acts of violence by the Dutch fishermen to the
King's Scottish subjects only led to the reply that the
States had issued a strong edict against such acts and
would punish them if proved. As no progress to any
agreement was being reached, the envoys suggested
a personal audience with the King. This was granted
on April 27. James was far from well, and in a very
irritable humour. He received them alone, and, contrary
to his habit, sat in his chair during the interview
with his hat on, while the ambassadors stood the whole
time with uncovered heads. Aerssen, after the usual
compliments, spoke at considerable length, in accordance
with the terms of his instructions, upon the East Indian
and other matters on which the States desired to treat.
The effect of this speech is best told in the words of
the original report of the proceedings:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'They [the envoys] noted that His Majesty was
entirely prejudiced and prepared by his Council to set
his heart against them. To their compliments he gave
no reply, letting them pass unnoticed. When they
(through their spokesman Aerssen) were entering into
the business, he said, "Make an end of your long
harangue. I will give a short and good answer. You
are a good orator, I know it well; when I was younger,
so was I also; now my memory fails me." Six times
with great discourtesy did he interrupt them.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The violence of the 'short and good answer' in
which he finally poured forth the pent-up vials of his
wrath upon the Dutchmen is at least a proof that
James, despite his age and infirmities, still possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
considerable powers of invective. Speaking of the
East Indian disputes, he exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'You have taken away the goods of my subjects,
have made war on, murdered and mishandled them,
without once thinking of what you have enjoyed from
this Crown, which has made you and maintained you.
You must give them satisfaction.... I hold that
you ought to show respect to my nation. You are
speaking of the accord (of 1619), I decline to treat with
you on equal terms. You have in the Indies a Man<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
who well deserves to be hanged. Your people over
there represent everywhere your Prince of Orange as
a great King and Lord, and hold me up as a little
kinglet, as if I stood under him, thus misleading the
barbarian kings.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tell me what you are thinking of doing, whether you
will take action and give me satisfaction or not? Will
you do it, then do it the sooner the better; it will be
best for you; when will you begin? Surely you are
like leeches, bloodsuckers of my realm, you draw the
blood from my subjects and seek to ruin me; there are
six points that show it clearly; take <em>the great fishery</em>&mdash;you
come here to land against the will of my subjects,
you do them damage, you injure them, you desecrate
the Churches, doing filthy acts in them, you hinder
them from fishing; the Greenland whale fishery you
wish to dispute with me, without making good the loss;
France and Spain have ceded it to me, with Denmark
I have come to an agreement, you alone wish to maintain
it against me. I would not endure it either from
France or from Spain, do you think I either can or will
bear it from you? In the Cloths you are playing at
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passe-passe</i>, as if you were laying a burden on your
inhabitants, and yet this is the cause; these (the Cloths)
are no more carried, therefrom as you may have heard
a mutiny and wellnigh a rebellion exists in my Realm.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Having mentioned these three points, the other
three appear to have escaped his Majesty's memory.
After this outburst the negotiations were renewed, the
East Indian questions being taken first. This admirably
suited the Dutch, who knew they had the upper
hand in the Indies and were anxious to shelve the
fishery dispute as long as possible. For months the
weary negotiations proceeded, until in August there
was once more a deadlock. The King again granted
an audience (August 16), was again angry, and with
small result. An event now occurred which gave rise
to fresh complaint. The Dutch fishermen off the
Scottish coast had encountered an Ostend vessel with
some Dutch prisoners on board. The Ostender was
attacked and an attempt made to set the captives free.
A conference was held on the matter in the King's
presence, September 25, and the Hollanders were
accused of a breach of neutrality. The envoys rejoined
that it was the Ostender which had committed a breach
of neutrality by bringing prisoners into Scottish waters,
and pointed out 'that no one had so great an interest
as his Majesty to prevent Spain from sharing the sovereignty
of the sea on which his Majesty was so mighty
and whereon his chief security lay'. This reference
to James's relations with Spain was more than the testy
King could brook.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It is you', he said, 'who are masters of the sea, far
and wide, you do just what you like, you hinder my own
subjects from fishing on my coasts, who at any rate
according to all Rights ought to enjoy the first benefit,
but when I raise the question, and urge you to observe
my rights, to listen to what I have to say, you will not
agree to a single word being spoken about it; yes,
my ambassador writes to me that he might just as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
speak to you of the rights of my fishery, as of a declaration
of war with you. When you are at war, you
say that your Government has not yet been granted
time for your community to get on its legs. In peace,
you have other excuses. The long and the short is,
you don't want to enter into it.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The ambassadors were, however, not to be entrapped
into a discussion of the Great Fisheries; remarking that
his Majesty had agreed to defer speaking about this
question, they skilfully turned his attention to other
subjects. One result of this conference was the
resolve of the Privy Council to make a serious effort
to accommodate the Greenland fishery dispute. A
formal statement of the English grievances was set
forth in a letter to the ambassadors, and they were
requested, now that far more than the three months'
delay which the King had conceded was past, to pay
up the indemnity of £22,000 for the losses that had
been suffered. The Netherlanders at once replied that
they were ready to consider the Greenland differences
as soon as the East Indian were settled, but not before.
Unless the East Indian negotiations were pushed on,
they threatened to return home (October 3). For
some two months accordingly the Indies held the field.
When, however, the middle of December had arrived
the Council once more repeated their demand that the
indemnity, which had been promised in 1619, should
now be handed over. The envoys denied having any
knowledge of such a promise. They would make
inquiries about it, meanwhile their instructions only
allowed them to discuss the Greenland question as
a whole and without prejudice. They asked for proofs
of the alleged promise. None were forthcoming. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
by raising this side-issue the Dutch achieved their
object of gaining time. An accord at last having
been reached on East Indian affairs, the envoys
announced that after fourteen months' sojourn in
London they were unable to remain longer. Caron,
they said, would have full powers to carry on negotiations
about the Greenland matter. So far as any
real settlement of disputes was concerned, the embassy
was again a complete failure. Even the accord in
the East was a sham. The English Company had
obtained a nominal position of equality with its Dutch
rival in the Indies, and a definite share of the coveted
trade in the Spice islands. But all the power was in
the hands of the Dutch, and such an artificial arrangement
was more likely, as events were speedily to show,
to breed fresh discords than to allay the old ones.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2>IV: 1623-1629</h2>


<p>The embassy of 1622 returned to the Netherlands
early in February, 1623. A few weeks later Prince
Charles, accompanied by the Duke of Buckingham,
was on his way to Madrid to woo in person his prospective
Spanish bride. No more conclusive proof
could have been shown of the lack of success of Aerssen
in obtaining any assurance of armed support from
King James for the States in their renewed war with
Spain or for the recovery of the Palatinate.</p>

<p>Yet, strangely enough, at this very time of increasing
political alienation, four English and two Scottish regiments
formed (as indeed was the case throughout the
remainder of the eighty years' war) the very kernel of
the States army, and campaign after campaign bore
the brunt of the fighting. When the Spaniards laid
siege to Bergen-op-Zoom in July, 1622, Maurice had
reinforced the garrison by fourteen English and Scottish
companies. The gallant defence of the town first
by Colonel Henderson, then, after this officer fell mortally
wounded, by Sir Charles Morgan, excited general
admiration in Europe. In October, Spinola, after
making repeated and desperate efforts to capture the
place, was compelled to raise the siege. These troops
were recruited by royal permission in England and
Scotland, remained British subjects, and were distinguished
by their national uniforms and colours, by the
beat of the drum and the march. They were, however,
in Dutch pay, and took an oath of allegiance to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
States-General, from whom the officers received their
commissions.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>This same period saw also the beginnings of rivalry
in the West as well as in the East. In 1621 a Charter
was granted to the Dutch West India Company. This
Charter was framed on the model of that of the East
India Company, and it was hoped that the new venture
might be attended by the same good fortune and phenomenal
success as had followed Dutch enterprise in
Java and the Malayan Archipelago. Far from being
a mere commercial undertaking, it was intended from
the first that the West India Company should be
required to equip considerable armed forces, naval and
military, wherewith to strike a blow at the Spanish
power in America, and cut off those sources of revenue
which supplied King Philip with the sinews of war.
In carrying out such projects of aggression in the
Spanish main there was less risk of disputes arising
between the Dutch and English than had been the case
in the East Indies. Nevertheless, the colonists and
traders of the two nationalities were in America also
rivals and competitors in the same localities. Netherlanders
and Englishmen had already for some years
before 1621 been carrying on traffic with the natives
and setting up trading posts side by side in the estuary
of the Amazon, and in the various river mouths along
the coast of Guiana. In 1609, by letters patent, a grant
was made by James I to Robert Harcourt, of Stanton
Harcourt, in the county of Oxford, for the planting
and inhabiting of the whole coast of Guiana between
the rivers Amazon and Essequibo, and this grant was
renewed to Roger North in 1619, and again by Charles I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to the Duke of Buckingham in 1626. Yet within the
limits of these grants the Dutch in 1616 established
themselves permanently on the river Essequibo, and in
1627 on the river Berbice, while a number of abortive
attempts were made to set up trading posts and colonies
at other points of this coast. More important than any
of these, a settlement had been made in 1614 on the
island of Manhattan at the mouth of the Hudson river,
a grant having been given at that date by the States-General
to a body of Amsterdam merchants of all unoccupied
land between Chesapeake Bay and Newfoundland.
This settlement and those in Guiana were in
1622 taken over by the newly erected West India
Company. Thus in North America the Dutch took
possession of the best harbour on the coast, and their
colony of New Netherland with its capital New Amsterdam
(afterwards New York) was thrust in like
a wedge between the English colonies of Virginia and
New England. In the West Indian islands and on the
Gold Coast of West Africa the keen traders of the two
nations also found themselves side by side, with the
result in almost all cases, as has been well said, that
the Dutch extracted the marrow, leaving the English
the bone.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It will at once be seen therefore that the
activities of the Dutch West India Company, though
it came into being primarily for the purpose of 'bearding
the King of Spain in his treasure house', were certain,
sooner or later, to come into conflict with English
enterprise and to enlarge the area within which their
respective interests and claims were divergent.</p>

<p>But to return to my immediate subject. The ill-success
of the embassy of 1622 in effecting any settlement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
except the accord relating to the East Indies, an
accord which was not regarded in Holland with much
favour and which was speedily to prove a failure,
caused considerable disquietude to the States. It was
resolved therefore to make another real effort to accommodate
the old grievances of the English in regard to
the acts of violence charged against the Dutch fishermen
both on the coast of Scotland and off Spitzbergen.
It was hoped that by so doing, any further raising of
the question of fishing rights might be avoided. The
news of the journey of Prince Charles to Madrid
changed disquietude into genuine alarm, lest James,
irritated as he was by a succession of fruitless negotiations
and long-protracted disputes, might be tempted
to cement the Spanish marriage by an alliance with
the hereditary foe, and to seek redress against the
United Provinces by force of arms. Steps were accordingly
taken to enforce strictly the placards by which
the skippers of the herring-busses were forbidden under
heavy pains and penalties to interfere with or to disturb
the Scottish fisherfolk in their industry (April 20, 27,
May 6, 1623), and they were also warned not to
approach too near to the coast. Caron was requested
to inform the English Council of these measures of
precaution. The States-General were likewise anxious
in their desire to arrive at a friendly understanding
that the claims for damages against the Greenland
(Northern) Company should be paid. But the old
difficulties supervened. The directors of the Greenland
Company reminded them of the counterclaim for
damages suffered at the hands of the English. To pay
therefore the English claim before demanding from the
Muscovy Company a simultaneous settlement of Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
grievances would be, they pointed out, playing into
King James's hands. It would be regarded as an
admission of his exclusive and particular rights in the
Spitzbergen fishery, rights which the Greenland Company
and the States had repeatedly refused to acknowledge.
So, despite pressure both from Carleton and
Caron, the matter dragged on. At last, December 14,
a letter was sent to Caron, denying that any promise
had been given by the embassy of 1618-9 of a one-sided
payment of damages, as stated by the English,
but expressing the willingness of the Dutch to make
a mutual settlement. As, however, so often before in
these negotiations, delay had served its purpose.</p>

<p>When this letter reached Caron, a dramatic change
in the English policy had taken place to the advantage
of the Netherlands. The negotiations with Spain
for the restitution of the Palatinate had broken down.
Philip IV and Olivares had never intended to purchase
the friendship of England at such a price, and the marriage
prospect, on which for so many years his heart
had been set, had to be reluctantly abandoned by
King James. 'I like not', he said, 'to marry my son
with a portion of my daughter's tears.'</p>

<p>The return of the Prince of Wales and the Duke
of Buckingham, October 5, angry at the treatment
accorded to them at Madrid, led to the overthrow of the
party at Court which had favoured a Spanish alliance.
Parliament was summoned, and Buckingham in advocating
an anti-Spanish policy found himself for once
a popular favourite. Pressed by his son, by Buckingham,
by Parliament, and by public opinion, the aged
King with a heavy heart saw himself compelled to
abandon his cherished scheme of recovering the Palatinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by peaceful negotiations, and to take steps for
armed intervention. The States-General, on seeing
the turn that events were taking, wisely determined to
send another embassy to London to take advantage of
the opportunity for concluding the wished-for offensive
and defensive alliance between England and the
United Provinces. There was this time no delay in
drawing up the instructions, and Aerssen and Joachimi,
the two best men they could have chosen, departed on
their mission February 24.</p>

<p>There can be little question that the moving cause
for the sending of this embassy with such unusual
dispatch is to be found in an interview between Sir
Dudley Carleton and Prince Maurice, which the former
records in a letter to the Duke of Buckingham dated
December 9, 1623.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I have thought fit', wrote the ambassador, 'to set
down at large (whilst it is fresh in my memory) an
opportunity as properly given unto me this day by the
Prince of Orange (who is the only person of power and
confidence we have here to treat withal) as I hope your
Grace will think it seasonably taken.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Some business at the Council of State, at which both
were present, having been got through more quickly
than was expected, Maurice, so Carleton informed his
correspondent,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'gave me a long hour's leisure afterwards in his garden,
which he himself desired of me ... he asked me
bluntly (after his manner) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui at'il de vostre mariage?</i><a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
I told him it was now at a stay upon this point, that
the restitution of the Palatinate must be first concluded.
And that the Queen of Bohemia was not only well
comforted with this assurance, but pleased herself with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a further conceit that the opportunity was never fairer
for this State to regain the King her father's favour,
and return to the ancient support of his Crowns, which
by way of gratitude for her good usage, since she had
her refuge into these parts, she could not but admonish
his Excellency of and advise him not to let it slip.
Here I took occasion to play my own part, and to
remember unto him how things had passed within the
compass of my experience from the beginning, letting
him know what friendship his Majesty had shewed this
State in making their truce; what sincerity in rendering
their cautionary towns according to contract when
they were demanded; what affection in supporting
their affairs during their late domestic disputes; what
care in settling our East-Indian differences; finally,
what patience in conniving at all the misdemeanours
and insolences of their seamen without seeking revenge.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Carleton then proceeds to defend the King's attitude
to the Dutch, 'whose ill course, pursued through some
years' continuance, bred a deserved distaste in his
Majesty'; and his listening on the part of Spain to
'fair overtures of friendship, being continually made
and confirmed by the tender of a match.... But (he
is careful to add) now the cause is removed, the effect
may possibly cease in like manner.' The reply of
Maurice was 'that nothing could be more certain than
the affection of this State to a Prince embracing their
cause of opposition to Spain. And if his Majesty could
take that resolution, he might dispose of these their
lives and fortunes.' A further discussion led finally to
the Prince's declaration, 'When the King would be
to this State as Queen Elizabeth was, this State would
be to him as it was to Queen Elizabeth.' The advice
of Carleton to the Duke is to seize the chance of effecting
a good understanding with the Netherlands. 'The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
present opportunity [to quote the actual words] of the
Prince of Orange's good affection, and strength of these
provinces both by sea and land as it yet stands, but
not possible so long to continue, being seasonably laid
hold of, his Majesty may have with this State a firm
and fruitful alliance.'</p>

<p>The embassy then, which reached England on February
26, 1624, had a comparatively easy task before
it. It was received by the populace with acclamations,
and by the King, now completely under the influence
of Buckingham, with friendliness and distinction.
Even the news of the (so-called) massacre of Amboina
in the far East, which was to arouse in England for
many years a bitter feeling of resentment against the
Dutch, did not now lead to any delay in the negotiations,
which proceeded smoothly from the first. Aerssen
and Joachimi had English public opinion with
them, and a treaty for a defensive alliance between the
two countries was signed on June 15. By this treaty
James allowed an additional force of 6,000 men to be
raised in England, the pay to be at his charges, the
States undertaking to refund the amount advanced on
the conclusion of a peace or truce. So quickly was the
enlistment carried out, that four regiments of 1,500 men
each, commanded by the Earls of Oxford, Essex, and
Southampton and Lord Willoughby de Eresby, landed
in Holland ready for service on July 23. The contingent
arrived at an opportune moment, as Spinola had just
invaded Dutch Brabant at the head of an army of
24,000 foot and 3,000 horse, and had laid siege to Breda.</p>

<p>This treaty of alliance of June 15, 1624, was followed
as a matter of course, by negotiations for a settlement
of the long-standing disputes about the Greenland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
fisheries indemnity and other questions, but despite the
efforts of the States-General and the two residents
Carleton and Caron, but little progress was made. The
directors of the Greenland (Northern) Company had
the powerful influence of Amsterdam behind them, and
they raised, with the same obstinacy as on previous
occasions, strong opposition to making any payment for
damages, unless the English agreed to satisfy their
counter-claim for losses sustained in 1613 and 1617.
Matters were still further delayed by the illness and
death of Noel Caron, December 11, 1624. Caron was
a real loss at this moment, for he had during fourteen
difficult and anxious years filled the post of ambassador
of the United Provinces in London with conspicuous
industry, ability, and tact. The selection of Albert
Joachimi, Lord of Ostend, as his successor was probably
the best that could have been made, and met with
general approval. He was a man of proved experience,
and had been recently in England with Aerssen with
the mission that so successfully concluded the treaty.
It was intended that he should at once enter upon his
duties and take with him to England instructions for
a prompt settlement of the Greenland indemnity, if
possible by a friendly agreement; if not, in any case
'decisively and authoritatively', and in their turn the
other pending disputes and complaints.</p>

<p>Events, however, occurred which effected so complete
a change in the political situation that his departure was
perforce delayed. On March 27, 1625, James I died.
A month later, Maurice, Prince of Orange, breathed his
last, April 25, 1625. Charles I ascended the throne of
England, and it was hoped this would mean a more
decisive intervention of England in foreign politics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
The new King was embittered against Spain, and it
was known that the Duke of Buckingham, who at this
time professed friendship for Holland, and through
private pique was even more hostile to the Spaniards
than his master, held an influence over him greater
even than that which he had exercised over his father.
It was largely through his efforts that, after the rupture
of the Spanish match, a marriage had been arranged between
the Prince of Wales and the sister of Louis XIII.
The accomplishment of this union was one of the very
first acts of the new reign. Charles and Henrietta
Maria were married at Paris by proxy, May 11, and at
Canterbury, June 12, with Anglican rites.</p>

<p>Richelieu was now firmly established in power, and in
his hands Henry IV's policy of hostility to the ascendancy
in Europe of the house of Habsburg was revived.
Charles was therefore not without hopes of obtaining
armed assistance from France in that war with Spain
for the recovery of the Palatinate on which his heart
was set. In the United Provinces, Frederick Henry,
Prince of Orange, succeeded to all the posts and to
more than the influence of his brother. He was, as a
general, the equal of Maurice, and was far superior to
him as a statesman. During his Stadholderate, strong
in the support and affection of all parties and classes,
Frederick Henry was able for many years, despite the
cumbersome and intricate machinery of government in
the Dutch Republic, to exercise a control over the
conduct of foreign affairs that was practically undisputed.
He, as the son of Louise de Coligny, had
throughout his life strong French leanings, and the aim
of his diplomacy was from the first to secure the goodwill
of Richelieu and the help of French troops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
subsidies for the Netherlands. To send Joachimi at
such a juncture to London to discuss the settlement of
a fishery indemnity was clearly inadequate. It was
resolved accordingly that with the newly appointed
resident ambassador a special embassy should go to
England to congratulate the King upon his accession
and his marriage, and, in view of the strained relations
between Charles and Spain, to negotiate a treaty between
the two countries on the basis of an offensive
and defensive alliance. Francis van Aerssen and
Rienck van Burmania were chosen as envoys extraordinary
for this mission. They set sail, accompanied
by Joachimi, on June 16. All the circumstances were
favourable to the success of their mission, no difficulties
supervened, and on September 17 the treaty of Southampton
was signed. By this time a great expedition
was being prepared in England for the destruction of
the port of Cadiz and the capture of the Plate fleet.
Already, efforts had been made by Buckingham to
persuade the States to allow 2,000 seasoned English
troops in their pay to serve on the great fleet he was
equipping, in exchange for 2,000 recruits. But although
the 2,000 recruits were sent over (June 19) to Rotterdam,
the States-General would not part with their veterans,
whose services they sorely needed. Sickness carried
off numbers of the raw levies, who were not allowed to
land, and the remains had to return in miserable plight
to Plymouth at the end of August. Being without pay,
these unhappy men had lived during the interval at the
personal charges of Sir Dudley Carleton. In a letter
to Sir F. Nethersole, secretary to the Queen of Bohemia,
dated August 30, the ambassador wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p><blockquote>

<p>'I have had no small trouble with 2,000 soldiers sent
hither out of the North of England to be exchanged
with the States for so many old musquettiers, which
the weakness of the States' army, especially in the
English nation, could not admit, and, having understood
his Majesty's intention to use these 2,000 in the service
of the fleet, I caused them three weeks since to be
embarqued at Rotterdam, where they have layn ever
since, attending the wind, but I hope they will now get
away.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Charles, having already quarrelled with his first Parliament,
which was dissolved August 12, had failed to
obtain the subsidies he required for carrying out his
ambitious foreign policy. The States, however, consented
to allow General Sir Edward Cecil and several
other officers of experience in their service to absent
themselves for three months and take part in the expedition
against Spain, provided that they took none of their
soldiers with them. Cecil, although a land soldier without
any naval experience, was induced by Buckingham
to take command of the great armada, a post for which
he was quite unfitted. The fleet, after many delays,
at last set sail October 5, badly equipped, with victuals
only for six weeks, foredoomed to failure. In accordance
with the terms of the treaty, a squadron of twenty Dutch
ships under William of Nassau, a natural son of Maurice,
took part in the expedition. There is no need to follow
its fortunes further here. 'One by one,' says Dr. Gardiner,
'all through the winter months the shattered
remains of the once powerful fleet came staggering
home, to seek refuge in whatever port the winds and
waves would allow.'</p>

<p>Such an ignominious issue to this great enterprise
was of evil omen to the new reign. It was wounding
to English pride and roused public indignation against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Buckingham to a high pitch. In these circumstances
it is not to be wondered at that the alliance between
Great Britain and the United Provinces did not prevent
a fresh crop of differences arising between them. The
massacre of Amboina rankled in the mind of Charles,
and it had not been forgotten or forgiven by his people.
The right of the English ambassador at the Hague
to a seat on the Council of State had strictly ceased
when the treaty which granted it came to an end with
the close of the truce in 1621. But Dudley Carleton
had continued without gainsaying, so long as Maurice
lived, to enjoy his former privileges. By a resolution
of the States, June 5, 1626, however, he was informed
that henceforth he was permitted to take part in the
deliberations of the Council not as a right, but simply
by courtesy. Carleton attempted to obtain a withdrawal
of the resolution, but in vain. As the most
important affairs were at this time no longer transacted
in the Council of State but in the States-General, the
loss of influence was not really great, nevertheless the
mere passing of such a resolution when the treaty of
Southampton was not yet a year old was resented by
the English as a slight. Difficulties had also arisen
over the restrictions placed and the duties levied upon
the Merchant Adventurers, who had the staple of the
English cloth trade at Delft. Worse than all, a number
of Dutch merchant vessels had been seized and searched
on the ground that they were carrying contraband and
trading with the Spanish enemy. The Hollanders
throughout the War of Independence had always
insisted on the right to freedom of commerce even
with their foes, and by supplying the Spaniards not only
with food but with arms and munitions, had made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
immense profits, which helped largely to fill the rebel
war-chest. It was the attempt of Leicester to stop
this commerce, which chiefly caused his unpopularity
in the Netherlands. The treaty of Southampton (arts.
20-23) had forbidden all such traffic, but the keen
traders of Amsterdam could not be restrained from the
secret evasion of a restriction, to which they had so
long refused to submit. Hence acts of reprisal on the
part of the English Government, and bitter complaints
on both sides.</p>

<p>Once again it was necessary to send a special envoy
to London. The chosen ambassador this time was
Jacob Cats, better known as the People's Poet of the
Netherlands than as a statesman, though he was far
from being undistinguished in the latter capacity, seeing
that he was to fill for a number of years the important
post of Grand Pensionary of Holland. He
departed upon his mission March 9, 1627. His object
was to negotiate a Navigation Treaty (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traité de Marine</i>)
dealing with the various thorny questions regarding
contraband of war and right of search at sea which had
been causing so much trouble. But no sooner had the
conferences with the Privy Council begun than the
Dutch envoy was confronted with complaints that
the old outstanding disputes, the indemnities claimed
in reparation for the Amboina massacre, and for the
acts of violence committed by the herring fishers off
the coast of Scotland, and by the whale fishers at Spitzbergen,
had never been settled. Cats had to plead
that these matters were not included in his instructions,
and after some controversy he succeeded in securing
the postponement of these obtrusive and troublesome
matters. They were at the first suitable opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
to be discussed with the resident ambassador, Joachimi,
who would be furnished with special instructions from
the States. The policy of delay, which had proved so
successful in the past, once more gained for the Netherlanders
all that they required. The fisheries went on,
under protest indeed, but undisturbed. The indemnities
continued to be claimed, but remained unpaid. The
main purpose of Cats's mission was, however, not
achieved. No agreement about contraband and right
of search and seizure was reached. The comment of
Aitzema upon the negotiations is worth reproducing; it
is scarcely possible to describe what took place more
pithily or with greater acuteness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'With these and such-like proposals, with plaints and
counterplaints, was the time spent, without either the
one or the other being made any the wiser. Each one
thinks that he is most in the right; everybody looks
outwards, nobody homewards, and for much of the time
each was taxing the other with offences in which they
themselves were the more guilty. The big fishes eat
the small ones. He who has the might uses it; every
one speaks merely of uprightness, of sincerity, of affection,
and there is nothing but deception and hypocrisy
on all sides. The English thought also (as was quite
true) that they had done much for the common cause
and for the Reformed Religion: and that it behoved
this State likewise to suffer some inconvenience in their
commerce; because otherwise all business which was
in England, would find its way to the United Provinces,
if these with too great and undisturbed freedom should
use the sea, and not the English. Thus the Ministers
of this State did not accomplish much. To Heer Cats,
however, an honourable farewell was accorded with
the usual present, and the dignity of Knighthood. He
returned to the Hague August 30.'</p></blockquote>

<p>The spring of 1627 had found the Government of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Charles I involved in so many difficulties that it is not
surprising that the King should not have found it possible
to take any decisive line in his negotiations with
the Dutch. He had quarrelled with his Parliament,
and knew not where to turn to raise the money to
meet the heavy liabilities in which he had involved himself.
The attack on Cadiz had utterly miscarried, and
had failed to give any help to the cause of the Palatinate.
At this moment of sore disappointment he had
seen with misgiving that the new Stadholder, Frederick
Henry, and his minister Aerssen, had turned to
France with friendly overtures, and had found Richelieu
willing to receive them. France had promised to the
States a yearly subsidy, and a loan of troops on condition
that the Dutch would send a squadron to assist
in the blockade of La Rochelle, and would undertake
not to conclude a peace or truce with Spain without the
knowledge and consent of the French King. Charles
felt that his strenuous efforts to increase his fleet and
render it more efficient, with the aim of making the
English navy supreme in the Channel and the North
Sea, were directly threatened by such an alliance. It
was known that it was the policy of Richelieu to
strengthen the position of France as a maritime power,
and the traditional English jealousy of French aggrandizement
was increased rather than diminished by the
close bond which united the royal families. The French
marriage had always been unpopular in England, great
resentment being felt at the concessions that had been
made with regard to the public performance of Roman
Catholic rites. Charles himself found the position of
things at Court so difficult that he was obliged finally
to take the strong step of sending back the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
attendants of the young Queen. This gave great
offence at Paris, and the soreness between the two
countries was aggravated by the high-handed action of
the English on the sea during the Spanish war. French
ships had been searched and seized, and in reprisals an
embargo had been laid upon English vessels and goods
at La Rochelle and other places. Finally, the countries
drifted into war. Charles hoped that he might secure
the friendly neutrality of Spain, but his efforts failed,
and Spain allied herself with France.</p>

<p>In June a great expedition sailed under the command
of Buckingham to relieve La Rochelle. To meet its
cost without the help of his Parliament, Charles had
been compelled to have recourse to forced loans and
other unpopular expedients, and the issue was to be
a disaster even more humiliating than that of Cadiz.
In these circumstances, while this fleet in the spring of
1627 was being prepared, but its destiny still unknown,
it was necessary for the King to keep on good terms
with the United Provinces, and to pursue a temporizing
policy with regard to the grievances that he had against
them. While therefore Jacob Cats, as special ambassador
from the States, was busily engaged in negotiations
with the English Government in London, Charles sent
on his part an envoy extraordinary to the Hague,
nominally for the presentation of the Order of the
Garter to the Prince of Orange, in reality to sound
the disposition of the Dutch Statesmen and to make
proposals to them.</p>

<p>The man selected to carry out this commission was
the former ambassador at the Hague, Sir Dudley (now
Lord) Carleton, who had returned to London in the
previous year. In his secret instructions (dated May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
1627) are several interesting passages.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The document
opens thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The mayne scope of your imployment consisting of
two points; the one to prevent the practices of the
French, who seeke by presentation of new treatyes,
and profers of summes of money, to make, as it were,
a purchase of the affection of that State, and to gaine
it from us; the other, to provide that no misunderstanding
growe upon such overtures of pacification as
are made unto us by the Spanyard; we may well
consider that in cases of this nature, with people so
composed as they are, there is required a very cautious
proceeding.... We would have you begin with
declaration of our purpose constantly to continue our
preparations against Spayne, as against a common
enemie, in conformity to the league, offensive and
defensive, betwixt us and that State, and to make the
same more manifest, you shall have a list of the
Shipping now sett out under our High Admiral, the
Duke of Buckingham, with such as we are now further
preparing for the security of these seas; and hereupon
you are to require them to arme, in like manner extraordinarely
to sea, according to treaty....'</p></blockquote>

<p>Thus was Carleton to attempt to blind the Dutch
statesmen as to the overtures that had been made to
Spain and as to the purpose of the fleet gathered at
Portsmouth. With regard to the second point, the
instructions proceed:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'We would have you take knowledge of such griefs
and discontentments, as their resident Ambassador
Joachimi, and Catz their extraordinary deputy, have
complained of against our seamen, and thereupon make
knowen the charge (wherewith you are well acquainted)
we have given certaine select persons of our Council to
treate with them, of all due and reasonable satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for what is past, and a reglement for the future; but
with all you are to remember unto them, that, as we
are to have a care of their contentments, so we are not
to neglect the protection we owe to our own subjects.'</p></blockquote>

<p>And then follows a setting out of the old grievances,
the Amboina affair and the differences between the
East India Companies generally, and the exactions
upon the Merchant Adventurers now having their
Court in the staple town of Delft under the title of
tare. There is no mention here of the fisheries. As
regards the choice of friendship with France or with
England, the instruction, after a recitation of all that
the Republic has owed to English goodwill in the past,
thus presents the alternative:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Therefore, as things may growe to greate extremity
betwixt us and the French King, in case you find no
disposition in the States to joyne with us in assistance,
as their enemys do with France, we like well you should
persuade them to hold themselves neutrall, whereby
to reserve to themselves the liberty of mediation of
attonement, to which we shall be at all times ready to
lend a willing ear to them, as common friends. And
as they may apprehend danger to their State, by want
of such pecuniary ayde as is verbally presented to them
by the French King as the price of their affections;
or may be prest to the renewing of the triennial treaty
of Compiegne, let them in their wisdomes, waigh
what is the less of evils, in forbearing for a while the
acceptation of the weak and faltering friendship of
France, which, being in warre with England, cannot
have meanes to assist them, though never so willing

<p>Finally, Carleton is requested to remonstrate with
the States for the difficulties they had raised to the
admission of his successor at the Hague&mdash;a nephew,
named Dudley Carleton like himself&mdash;to a seat in the
Council of State, which had always hitherto been granted
to all English ambassadors and agents since 1585.</p>

<p>Carleton had his first audience in the assembly of
the States-General, June 14/24, and a second five days
later. In the first he read an address setting forth the
various objects of his diplomatic mission; in the second
he asked permission of the States for the Prince of
Orange to accept the Garter. In a letter dated June
27 (o.s.), to Lord Killultagh, the ambassador gives an
account of a conference that he had with a deputation
of the States-General, consisting of one member representing
each province. 'He laid open to them', he
writes, 'all that had passed from the beginning to the
end', and tried to persuade them of the advantage of
clinging to the English in preference to the French
alliance. He found it, however, a difficult task to remove
the apprehensions that were felt that Charles's quarrel
with France meant a drawing nearer to Spain. Carleton,
at the same time, does not scruple to point out that the
fact that he has gone to Holland without any money
to pay even interest on the expenses that had been
incurred by the States for the maintenance of Mansfeld's
English levies in 1625, or for the creditors of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Queen of Bohemia, or for preventing the forfeiture
of 'His Majesty's Jewells, which are in pawn at
Amsterdam', would be ruinous to his mission, and begs
for the necessary cash to be sent. The money, it is
needless to say, was not forthcoming, and such was the
suspicion against England that, despite Carleton's efforts
to secure for the English resident ambassador a seat
on the Council of State, the proposal was rejected by
the vote of every province separately. Nevertheless
there was genuine alarm in the Netherlands that the
continuance of the war between France and England
would be injurious to their interests by forcing one of
the combatants to seek the alliance of Spain. The
missions of Cats to England and of Carleton to the
Hague, though they failed in bringing about any real
settlement of the differences between the two powers,
at least effected an understanding that, for a time at
any rate, grievances were not to be pressed. The
interests of Dutch trade rendered the undisturbed
passage of the Channel, free from interference by
hostile fleets or cruisers, a consideration of the very
utmost importance.</p>

<p>It was resolved, therefore, to send yet another special
embassy to England to offer the mediation of the States
between the belligerent powers, and to negotiate for
the release of the many Dutch ships which had been
seized on the high seas and kept in English harbours.
The lord of Randwijk and Adrian Pauw, pensionary of
Amsterdam, were accordingly sent. They arrived in
London, January 25, 1628, and stayed in England some
fourteen months. Carleton meantime remained at the
Hague. In May of this same year the Earl of Carlisle
joined him, bringing further instructions from the King.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
By these instructions he was bidden to assist Carleton
in pressing upon the States the advantages of friendship
with England in preference to France, and the necessity,
if they wished to obtain it, of forbidding the construction
of French war-vessels in the Dutch ports, and of punishing
adequately the perpetrators of 'the foule and
bloody fact' of Amboina. It will thus be seen that
diplomacy during these years 1627 and 1628 was indeed
busy, so busy that it is by no means easy to see light
clearly amidst such a tangled web of negotiations.
This is certain, that they had small result. The Prince
of Orange, and his chief adviser Francis van Aerssen,
had made the French alliance the sheet-anchor of their
policy. They wished to be on friendly terms with
England, and to bring the war, which was so injurious
to Dutch interests, to a speedy conclusion, but they
distrusted the intentions of Charles I, and knew that
the breach with his Parliament in any case must deprive
him of the resources for carrying out any bold and
active intervention in the German war. They suspected,
moreover, that it was not unlikely that Charles might
follow in his father's footsteps and strive to help his
relatives in the Palatinate by means of negotiations
with Spain rather than by hostilities against that power.
The efforts of Carleton and Carlisle met therefore with
little or no success. The influence of Amsterdam in the
States of Holland was too strong for any steps to be
taken to punish those who had been concerned in the
Amboina tragedy, and the English demands were met
by evasion and delay. But though Carleton was unsuccessful,
the envoys in London, in carrying out their
task as mediators between England and France, were
helped by the pressure upon Charles of the financial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
difficulties in which, after the assassination of Buckingham
(August 23, 1628), he was becoming more and more
involved. The dissolution of March, 1629, was a final
breach with his Parliament. The King had therefore
little or no alternative but to bring his war with France
to a speedy conclusion. The Dutch envoys, on their
part, did their best to remove the obstacles to an Anglo-French
understanding, and peace was signed April 24,
1629.</p>

<h2>V: 1629-1641</h2>


<p>The foreign policy of Charles I during the eleven
years of autocratic rule which followed the dissolution
of Parliament in 1629, was conditioned by his lack
of money. His schemes were ambitious and were
obstinately pursued, and the charge that has frequently
been preferred against him of inconstancy and fickleness,
though it has a basis of truth, is on the whole
unjust. Charles's projects had to be frequently modified,
because he found himself without the means for carrying
them out. In November, 1630, peace was concluded
with Spain. It was his dearest desire to see
the Palatinate restored to the Elector Frederick, and
his sister, to whom he was much attached, freed from
the necessity of living as an exile in Holland; but
the cost of a military expedition to the aid of the
Protestants in Germany was prohibitive. He was also
suspicious of French motives and of the policy underlying
their alliance with the Dutch. Perhaps at this
time the predominant idea before Charles's mind was
the restoration of the navy to a position of supremacy
in the British seas. His most earnest endeavours
were for some years directed to this end, but its
attainment was seriously threatened by the close
bonds which united the powerful fleets of the Dutch
Republic with the growing naval strength of France.</p>

<p>In these circumstances, he attempted to pursue his
father's policy of seeking to counterbalance the Franco-Dutch
alliance by a good understanding with Spain,
through whose intervention with the Emperor he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
hoped he might be able to secure for Frederick V
some portion at any rate of his ancestral possessions.
In 1631 a treaty with Spain for the partition of the
Netherlands was actually drawn up, but it came to
nothing, and its failure was followed by negotiations
with Gustavus Adolphus. These also were fruitless,
for Charles was unable to offer the Swedish King the
military assistance without which the proffered alliance
had no value. Hopes, however, no doubt lingered in
Charles's mind that the phenomenal success of Gustavus
would lead to the restoration of the Elector Palatine
to his rights, but Gustavus was slain at Lützen
(November, 1632), and the disastrous defeat of the
Swedes and their Protestant allies at Nördlingen
(August, 1634) gave a decisive superiority in Germany
to the Hispano-Imperialist forces. The Habsburg
family alliance had for the time completely gained the
upper hand.</p>

<p>Charles, who had been tentatively making overtures
to France, now turned once more to Spain (October,
1634) with a fresh scheme for the partition of the Netherlands,
and though the time was now past for any real
change in Spanish policy, a treaty was actually signed
(May 1, 1635) by which the English King agreed to
assist the Spaniards with a naval force against the
Dutch. He had been impelled to take this step from
fear of French designs. The battle of Nördlingen
had had the effect of drawing the French and Dutch
nearer together in the common dread of a Habsburg
predominance. A treaty of subsidies was at once
agreed upon, and it was followed (February, 1635) by
an offensive and defensive alliance between the two
powers. Both France and the United Provinces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
bound themselves not to make a separate peace, and
it was provided that the Spanish Netherlands&mdash;the
southern provinces, by the death of the Archduchess
Isabel, had in 1633 reverted to Spain&mdash;should be conquered
and partitioned between the two contracting
parties. Charles had therefore looked to a Spanish
alliance as a counterpoise to a Franco-Dutch supremacy
in the 'narrow seas'. He hoped also that he might at
the same time secure favourable terms for his nephew&mdash;Frederick
V had died in November, 1632&mdash;in the
Palatinate. He was soon to learn by the publication
of the Treaty of Prague (May 30, 1635) that the
Emperor had transferred the territory and the electoral
dignity of the Palatinate to the Duke of Bavaria.
Direct negotiations with Vienna, backed, as they were,
by no force, were barren, and Charles was compelled
to see in the aid of France, who had concluded an
offensive and defensive alliance with the Swedes, two
months after that with the States, his only hope for
the furtherance of his nephew's interests. Richelieu
had now definitely ranged himself with the two leading
Protestant powers in a league against the house of
Austria, and had pledged all the military and financial
resources of France to the task of carrying out the
policy of Henry IV, which a quarter of a century
before had been rendered abortive by the dagger of
Ravaillac.</p>

<p>The States judged this to be a fitting time to send
over to England a special envoy, and Cornelis van
Beveren, lord of Strevelshoek, was selected for the
post. He set out for London, March 19, 1636. His
instructions were to act in concert with Joachimi and
the French ambassador De Senneterre, in urging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Charles to join in a triple bond with the United
Provinces and France for the purpose of making
a combined attack upon Spain. Van Beveren was to
point out that only by such a course could he lend any
effectual assistance to his nephew. It was hoped that
Charles Lewis, who was now residing at the English
Court, would use all his influence in forwarding the
objects of the mission.</p>

<p>The negotiations, however, were doomed to take
a very different direction from what had been intended.
On April 5 the Secretaries of State, Windebank and
Coke, came to Van Beveren with a communication
from the King. It was to the effect that Charles was
preparing to send out a fleet 'to preserve and maintain
his sovereignty and hereditary rights over the sea, and
for the preservation and protection of commerce', and
the Dutch envoy was informed that no one would in
future be allowed 'to fish in the King's seas without
express licence and suitable acknowledgement.' So
long a time had elapsed since the last attempt at
interference with the Dutch fishing that all mention of
it had been omitted from the instructions of Van
Beveren; it was hoped, indeed, that the question
would not be revived. On Van Beveren expressing
his astonishment at this sudden change of policy, and
asking for the reasons which had prompted it, he was
referred to the recently published <cite>Mare Clausum seu
Dominium Maris</cite>, by John Selden, in which he would
find a complete exposition of the King's rights and of
the object he had in asserting them. This famous
work, written originally, as the author himself tells us,
at the command of James I, to establish the claims of
the King to the exclusive sovereignty of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
seas, had for some years remained unprinted. The
attention of Charles having been drawn to it, he read
it carefully, and immediately commanded its publication.
Its appearance in December, 1635, had thus an
official character, for its principles and policy were
henceforth adopted by Charles, as matters demonstrated
by irrefutable proofs, and they were endorsed by
English public opinion wherever Selden's treatise,
which rapidly passed through two editions, was read.</p>

<p>Van Beveren, seriously disturbed, at once wrote home
for further instructions, and his fears were not allayed
when at an audience, April 15, the King declined the
proffered alliance, and expressed his wish for a discussion
of the question of maritime rights. His
dispatch at this very time of Thomas Howard, Earl of
Arundel, on a special mission to Vienna, showed
indeed that he still trusted to the result of direct
negotiations with the Emperor. Arundel had to pass
through Holland, where his presence on such an
errand warned the Dutch that the attitude of Charles
was anything but friendly, and that grave dangers
might be threatening them. In these circumstances
the States-General, leaving Van Beveren to continue
his negotiations in England, summoned Joachimi to
the Hague to consult with them as to the course it
was best to take should Charles persist in his purpose.
They had need of his advice, for May 10/20, 1636,
a proclamation was issued by the King&mdash;'for restraint
of Fishing upon His Majesty's Seas and Coasts without
licence'&mdash;which plainly stated the King's intention
'to keepe such a competent strength of shipping upon
Our Seas, as may by God's Blessing be sufficient, both
to hinder further encroachments on Our Regalities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and assist and protect those our good Friends and
Allies, who shall, henceforth, by vertue of Our Licences
(to be first obtained) endeavour to take the benefit
of Fishing upon our Coasts and Seas, in the places
accustomed.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>For some weeks no steps were taken to enforce the
proclamation, but on July 20 news reached Van Beveren
that an English fleet of fifteen vessels was ready
to sail to the fishing-grounds with orders to seize as
prizes any boats that refused to pay the toll. To plead
for delay was the only course open to the Dutch envoy.
He had an interview with the King in person at Windsor,
July 27, but was able to effect nothing. Charles
assured him that the object of the fleet, so far from
being hostile, was intended for the protection of the
fisher-folk especially against the Dunkirk pirates (from
whose daring attacks they had as a matter of fact
suffered much during the past few years), and that the
payment of a small toll was but a recognition of the
benefit they would receive. With this doubtful assurance
he had perforce to rest content. On July 31
twelve ships under Vice-Admiral Pennington actually
sailed northwards, and compelled the fishermen that they
encountered&mdash;most of the boats had already returned
home, it being late in the season&mdash;to pay the toll. No
opposition was made. One of the captains of the Dutch
guard-ships had, however, in consequence of his protest
against these proceedings, been taken prisoner.</p>

<p>The Dutch Government on hearing this news took
decided action. Joachimi was ordered at once to return
to England, and as soon as possible to seek an audience
with the King. Armed with instructions, Joachimi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
accordingly left Holland, August 18, convoyed by
a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Van Dorp. He
landed at Southwold, and finding that Charles was at
Woodstock he made his way at once to that place.
The interview took place September 3.</p>

<p>In accordance with his instructions the ambassador
expressed their High Mightinesses astonishment that
an Armada should have appeared in the midst 'of the
poor fishers and herring-catchers of these lands', and
had seized one of the captains of the guard-ships and
caused such terror among the fisher-folk that the larger
part of them had fled and dared no longer pursue their
avocation. His Majesty was courteously requested to
withdraw his demand for a licence and to allow the
fishers to ply their trade as heretofore, and it was proposed
that a conference should be held to consider
the fishery question in its entirety. Joachimi did not
neglect the opportunity of pointing out how closely the
questions of the fisheries and of the Palatinate hung
together. Charles was unmoved by these representations,
and finally, September 9, declined the proposal
of a conference. 'There could be no debating', he
said, 'about his Majesty's rights already confirmed
publickly before all the world'. The recognition of his
rights was a condition which must precede negotiation.
After discussion with Van Beveren, seeing that the
situation was serious, Joachimi determined to return to
the Hague. His start was, however, delayed by various
causes, and he did not make his appearance before the
States-General until November 22.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the aspect of affairs had not improved.
Admiral Van Dorp, who had in the middle of August
convoyed Joachimi to England, also had his instructions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
He was first to sail with his fleet to the fishing grounds
to prevent any injury being done to the fishermen.
This accomplished, he was to blockade Dunkirk, and to
destroy any privateers or Spanish ships cruising in the
Channel. His orders were strict, that he was not to
allow his ships to be visited or searched, and during
his blockade of Dunkirk he was to keep a watchful eye
upon the fisheries of the land and to protect them
against the Spaniards or any others who should wish to
molest them. These instructions were in fact a direct
reply and challenge to the proclamation of King Charles.</p>

<p>The Dutch herring fleet having recovered from their
alarm had ventured out, as was their custom, about the
middle of September, to the English coasts for a second
catch of fish. The Earl of Northumberland had been
charged with the collection of the toll from them. He
had, however, at this time but three ships with him,
and learning that a Dutch squadron of sixteen sail was
near at hand he promptly sent for reinforcements. In
response, twelve vessels were dispatched from the
Thames, October 8. Actual hostilities, however, did
not take place. One large detachment of 'busses', not
having a sufficient convoy, was made to pay, the rest
were left unmolested. The English commander finding
himself in the presence of thirteen Dutch war-ships
did not venture to attack them. Both sides showed in
fact more caution than aggressiveness. The authorities
in Holland, however, did not approve Van Dorp's attitude
and conduct, and he was requested to resign his
command.</p>

<p>The course of events was fortunately to relieve
a strain that was rapidly approaching the breaking
point. Charles's negotiations with the Emperor had led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
to no satisfactory result. It was at last made clear to
him that by this means there was no hope of obtaining
a restoration of the Palatinate. Van Beveren seized
the opportunity of placing himself in communication
with Charles Lewis, at this time residing in London,
with the hope of securing through his aid a better
understanding between England and the States.
Charles Lewis was only too willing in his own interests
to act as intermediatory, and his influence with his
uncle was great. His mother, the Queen of Bohemia,
was at this time writing pressing letters to her brother
begging for his active intervention, and it was urged
upon King Charles that the assistance of the Dutch
army and navy would be far more valuable to him than
any sum of money that could be extracted in the shape
of toll from the fisher fleet. On the point of the toll
the King showed himself not unwilling to yield, but not
one inch would he concede of his claims to the undisputed
sovereignty of the sea. If he withdrew his proclamation
and allowed the Dutch, as heretofore, freedom
of fishing without licence, it would be in compensation
for services rendered in the cause of the Palatinate,
not as a right based upon ancient treaties and long
usage. The Dutch, on the other hand, were keenly
alive to all that was involved in any admission of such
a dominion of the sea as that claimed by the English
King, and were determined not to grant it. On
Charles's side, however, financial difficulties at this
time rendered any straightforward course impracticable.
The King had not the means to fit out an expedition
for the help of his nephew, and he hovered hither and
thither between divergent policies in the vain hope that
without recourse to a Parliament he could find some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
way of furthering the cause of Charles Lewis, without
involving himself in an outlay that he was unable to
meet. Scheme after scheme floated before his mind,
all of them equally visionary when confronted with the
stern realities of impecuniousness. From Ferdinand
and Philip he turned to Richelieu. The French armies
were advancing in Lorraine and Elsass, and were co-operating
with the Dutch in the Netherlands, and with
the Swedes and their Protestant allies in Germany.
For awhile it appeared as if Richelieu were inclined to
an English alliance. In February and March, 1637,
a treaty was indeed actually drawn up. It is strongly
suspected, however, that the Cardinal was never in real
earnest, and only wished to amuse the English King
with negotiations, and thus at any rate keep him back
from purchasing Spain's goodwill on the Rhine by an
offer to take part in a joint naval attack upon the
United Provinces. Charles was quite aware of the
solidarity of the bond which united France and the
States, and that a French alliance implied friendly relations
with the Dutch. On February 13 therefore he
sent the Secretary of State, Coke, to Van Beveren,
who was still in London, to reopen direct negotiations.
It was now proposed that there should be a combined
Anglo-Dutch naval expedition in which a French
squadron should be invited to participate, which, after
driving the Spanish fleets from the sea, should effect
a landing in the Peninsula and dictate terms to
Philip IV. Meanwhile the King expressed his willingness
to allow the Dutch fishermen to pursue their
industry along the coasts of his kingdoms freely and
without hindrance. During the following season the
English fleet would blockade the Flemish ports, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would not appear on the fishing grounds nor make any
demands for licences. But with this latter concession
the States were not satisfied. Such an act of toleration
implied that Charles maintained to the full his claim to
the undisputed sovereignty of the sea. He would not
during the time of the allied operations press his rights
to issue licences and exact toll, he only waived them as
a favour. Further than this he could not go. On the
question of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominium maris</i>, despite the earnest
entreaties of Charles Lewis, he refused any compromise.
But on the other side there was no less obstinacy. The
Prince of Orange himself wrote (March 1) to Van Beveren,
that he was on no account to commit himself or
assent to any terms unless the proclamation concerning
the fishing licences was first withdrawn. With France
the negotiations for an alliance appeared to be proceeding
smoothly, the treaty lay ready for signature, and on
March 4 Charles sent full powers to his ambassador at
Paris to conclude the matter. On the 23rd came the
news that difficulties had arisen, and that France also
required that the proclamation should be withdrawn,
at least during the period of the treaty. But Charles,
though the negotiations still dragged on, absolutely
declined to discuss a question which concerned his
rights and honour, and so he now once more lent a not
unwilling ear to the tempting offers made to him by
the Spanish ambassador. Spain was willing in return
for an offensive and defensive alliance against the
United Provinces to recognize the King's sovereign
rights on the seas, and to hand over at once the Lower
Palatinate. They even went so far as to promise the
surrender of certain towns in Flanders as pledges for
the ultimate restitution of the Upper Palatinate and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the electoral dignity to Charles Lewis. It is extremely
doubtful whether these proposals were serious, in any
case they were not seriously entertained.</p>

<p>The mere prospect of an Anglo-Spanish agreement
had, however, the effect which Charles probably
intended it to have in making the French and Dutch
more conciliatory. Negotiations were resumed, and
the fishery question by mutual consent was relegated
to the background. It was finally arranged that
a conference should be held at Hamburg at the end of
June to settle the terms of a quadruple alliance between
France, England, the United Provinces, and Sweden.
Terms of peace were to be laid before the Emperor by
the four powers conjointly. In case of their rejection
the King of England was to declare war against Austria
and Spain. Everything now seemed to be working
smoothly, and no one doubted that the conference
would meet and that its issue would be favourable.
The Dutch fishermen had not been interfered with,
and such was the confidence in the States that England
had now finally thrown in her lot with the coalition
against the house of Austria, that instructions were
sent to Van Beveren to return home where his presence
was required.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the Dutch after his recall did not show
any eagerness to proceed. Reflection made them doubtful
about Charles's bona fides. They misliked the high
pretensions of the English to the sovereignty of the
seas, for in his insistence on this point the King was
but voicing the sentiment of his people. It was
becoming a really grave issue of practical politics.
With astonishment the Dutch learnt that Charles had
even given a patent granting exclusive rights of fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
off the shores of Newfoundland, and had forbidden
foreigners to fish in those waters without his licence,
April, 1637. If he claimed the right to do this, where
was the line to be drawn? Under pressure from their
French allies, Charles van Cracauw, the ambassador
of the States in Denmark, was at length appointed to
represent the United Provinces at the Hamburg Conference,
but his instructions were not drawn up, and he
continued to reside for some time longer in Copenhagen.
Throughout the whole of 1637 the Dutch could not be
moved to take any further steps in the matter. In the
letters of Hugo Grotius (at this time Swedish resident
ambassador at Paris) to the Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna
many interesting references are made to the
attitude of the States, and it must be remembered that
Grotius not only had access to the best sources of information,
but had an unrivalled acquaintance with the
question which was uppermost in the minds of all
Dutch statesmen, the freedom of the sea and of the
fisheries. On June 4, the very day after the nomination
of Cracauw as delegate for the conference, Grotius
writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The ambassador of the States in England informs
me that the Spaniards there have great power&mdash;that
they wish that the restitution of the Palatinate should
be regarded as a certain thing; that they promise aid
for the safeguarding of the possession of the sea against
the Dutch. Would that these things were not true!
The same adds that proposals were made by the
Spaniards that after the death of this Bavarian the
electoral law should be altered, conditions were even
offered by the Spaniard to the English, if they could
be dragged into war against the Dutch Republic, which
however I do not fear. For I see that the action of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the English is principally directed to the aim of having
their commerce into all nations free and to deprive
others of theirs. The Dutch had formed a hope that
the contest about the fishery would this year be at
rest; but I see that the English envoys, who are here
[at Paris] hold that for uncertain.'</p></blockquote>

<p>A fortnight later (June 18) occurs the following
passage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'After I had written this there came to me the
English Envoy Extraordinary, Lord Leicester.... He
says, that Northumberland (to whom he is nearly related)
is again about to disturb the Dutch in their
liberty of using the sea, unless the Dutch purchase it
by great services to the Palatine house and by declarations
not injurious to English rights. I, restraining
myself from a definite declaration about the controversy,
have been content to demonstrate, how necessary
liberty of fishing was to that Republic and how necessary
the Republic itself to the security of all Europe.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Such being the feelings and the relations subsisting
between the two countries, it can excite no astonishment
that the States were exceedingly cautious before committing
themselves to an alliance, which might entail
further sacrifice upon them, and tie their hands in a
matter of primary importance to their welfare. According
to Grotius, proposals were made for holding the
conference at the Hague instead of Hamburg, in order
to make sure of Dutch co-operation. But they came
to nothing. Charles, however, in the spring of 1638
appears to have been really in earnest. Again and
again the English Resident at the Hague appeared before
the States-General to urge them to send a representative
to the conference. Not, however, until fresh pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
had been put upon them in the name of France and
Sweden by the French ambassador, D'Estampes, were
definite orders sent to Van Cracauw to go to Hamburg,
April 8. Even now he did not have any powers given
to him to negotiate as plenipotentiary, but was required
to refer all matters to the States-General for their
decision. Already, on March 4, a new treaty had been
concluded between France and Sweden for the joint
prosecution of the war, but the quadruple alliance was
never accomplished. Difficulties and intrigues prevented
the ratification either of the Anglo-French or
Anglo-Swedish Treaties, and the States were more than
half-hearted in the business. The ill success of the
young Elector Palatine, who had taken the field in the
spring of this year at the head of a force raised by the
help of his uncle Charles I, virtually brought the conference
to an end. Charles Lewis's army was completely
defeated at Lemco on October 8. Differences, which
had been for some little time endangering the friendly
relations of England and France, now came to a head.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
The representatives of the powers gathered at Hamburg,
only to disperse without result. The long drawn out
negotiations gave birth to nothing but sterile discussions.
The outbreak, indeed, of the troubles in Scotland regarding
'Laud's Liturgy', and the resistance that was being
offered to the collection of ship-money, effectually crippled
Charles's efforts on behalf of his nephew in Germany.
Richelieu no longer saw any advantage in tying his
hands by entering into an alliance which promised so
little. He preferred therefore to cut himself adrift from
the English connexion, and to trust to his alliances with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Sweden and the United Provinces<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> for pushing on the
war vigorously. It was not for Protestantism that he
was fighting, but for the aggrandizement of France at
the cost of the House of Habsburg.</p>

<p>This failure of his efforts to bring about, in conjunction
with France, a coalition of the Protestant powers for
the reconquest of the Palatinate and the restoration of
his nephew to his electoral dignity and possessions, made
Charles turn his eyes once more to Spain. The presence
at the English Court of Mary de Medicis and the
Duchess de Chevreuse in 1638 gave fresh life to that
party, who had always favoured a Spanish alliance.
The news that the Spaniards were making great preparations
for a determined attack upon the United
Provinces led the King to hope that, despite previous
disappointments, he might be able to forward by friendly
negotiations with Spain the cause of Charles Lewis.
The help of the English fleet could not but be serviceable
to a Spanish naval expedition, and possibly Charles
had visions of being able to attain through this means
that undisputed sovereignty of the British seas which,
since the publication of Selden's book, he had set before
himself, as we have seen, as one of the chief and unchangeable
objects of his policy, and at the same time,
perhaps, the pecuniary assistance he so much needed
for the suppression of the Scottish rebellion against his
authority. With characteristic uncertainty and wavering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
however, while negotiating with Spain, the King
did not cease his endeavours to gain French support
for his nephew. The Spanish preparations caused
uneasiness in Paris, as well as at the Hague, and the
English fleet was an asset not to be despised in the
event of a Spanish armada threatening to dominate
the Channel. The death of Duke Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar
in July, 1639, left the powerful force of mercenaries
which he had commanded without a leader.
Charles wished to buy their services for the Elector
Palatine, but he could only do this through the good
offices of Richelieu, who was already offering good terms
to the 'Bernardines' to enter the French service. A
treaty between the French Government and the chief
officers of the 'Bernardine' army was in fact on the
point of being concluded, when Charles Lewis made his
appearance at the head-quarters with a supply of English
money and tried to induce the leaders to place themselves
under his command, as an independent force.
The result was his immediate arrest by Richelieu's
command, October, 1639. He was imprisoned at Vincennes
for several months. This act was a final breach
of good relations between France and England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles's approaches to Spain had been
equally unfortunate. The Cardinal Infant, Ferdinand,
the victor of Nördlingen, had, as Governor-General of
the Netherlands, been successful in the conduct of the
war against the Dutch and French in the years 1638
and 1639. In the latter year Olivares determined to
dispatch a powerful Spanish reinforcement by sea to
the Netherlands to take part in the next campaign.
Accordingly, early in September, a fleet left the Spanish
ports consisting of seventy-seven vessels, many of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of the largest size, commanded by a veteran admiral
who had seen much service, Antonio de Oquendo. Its
object was to disembark at Dunkirk an expeditionary
force of 10,000 men. A Dutch squadron had been
cruising in the Channel all the summer, keenly on the
look-out for the Spaniards, under the command of
Lieutenant-Admiral Martin Harpertzoon Tromp. On
September 16 he sighted the armada. He had with
him at the moment only thirteen ships. But without
hesitation he fiercely attacked the Spaniards, and after
a tremendous fight he forced Oquendo to fly for refuge
to the English coast. Oquendo, after passing through
the Straits of Dover, anchored under the lee of the
Downs, side by side with an English squadron of ten
ships under Vice-Admiral Pennington. Tromp sent at
once urgent messages to Holland for reinforcements.
With a squadron that joined him from Dunkirk he lay
in the offing blockading the Spanish fleet in the Downs.
In all the harbours of Holland and Zeeland the greatest
efforts were now made to send every available ship to
sea at the earliest moment. Day by day Tromp's fleet
increased in number. His orders were uncompromising.
He was to attack the Spaniards wherever he found
them, as soon as he was in a position to do so with
success. Accordingly, on October 21, being now at the
head of a fleet of 105 sail with 12 fireships, the Dutch
admiral, although the Spaniards still lay in English
waters, resolved to take the offensive. Detaching thirty
ships under Vice-Admiral De With to watch Pennington,
he sailed straight for the enemy's galleons as they
sheltered under the cliffs between Dover and Deal.
The contest was sharp, but decisive. Under cover of
a fog, Oquendo himself with seven vessels made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
way to Dunkirk. All the rest were captured or destroyed.
Some 15,000 Spaniards perished, about 1,800
were taken prisoners. The Dutch only lost two ships
and about 100 killed and wounded. Tromp had won
one of the most crushing of naval victories, and had
annihilated the power of Spain upon the sea.</p>

<p>This daring infringement of English neutrality could
not but give deep offence to King Charles, and be
hurtful to the feelings of the English people. It was
at once felt in the States that an explanation must be
offered for the instructions given to Tromp, which had
been so successfully carried out. It was accordingly
resolved to dispatch a special envoy to London, and
Francis van Aerssen (now generally known as Lord of
Sommelsdijk) was himself chosen to undertake the
difficult mission. His instructions were that he should
complain of the help frequently afforded to the
Spaniards by the English, and plead that the attack
of Tromp at the Downs was a necessary sequel to the
previous encounter from which the Spanish fleet had
fled to seek refuge in English waters, and that it was
justified by Art. 15 of the Treaty of Southampton.
He was further to express the readiness of the States
to conclude with the King a fresh treaty of alliance.
Sommelsdijk found everything against him. The
King was very angry at the gross affront to his honour
and his sovereignty of the seas, and the most influential
of his counsellors, among them Strafford and Laud,
were strongly anti-Dutch. The affair was made an
excuse for pressing forward the collection of ship-money,
and the Spanish party continually gained
strength. The Queen-Mother of France and Madame
Chevreuse, who were then at the English Court, did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
their utmost to further the cause of Spain, and there
was talk of cementing an alliance by the marriage
of the Princess Royal with the heir to the Spanish
crown.</p>

<p>Sommelsdijk, finding he could effect no good result,
asked permission to return to Holland.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> He probably
knew that Charles was anxious not to break with the
States, for his request brought about a change in the
King's demeanour. Charles requested him to remain,
and showed himself more friendly. On January 16
the ambassador, whose correspondence with Frederick
Henry at this time is of great interest, wrote to the
Stadholder that he was not without some hopes now
of soothing the resentment of the King by abstaining
as far as possible from the irritating topic of the
Downs, and letting it fall into oblivion by drawing his
attention to other subjects of discussion. Sommelsdijk
had persuasive manners, and by the exercise of patience,
tact, and conciliation, he did succeed to a large extent
in his aim. He was much helped in his task by
another negotiation which was now set on foot.
Frederick Henry, in this same month of January, 1640,
sent over a secret envoy, Jan van der Kerkhoven, Lord
of Heenvliet, to propose a marriage between his only
son and an English princess. The matter had been
first suggested by Marie de Medicis during a visit to
the Hague in 1638. The proposal was favourably
received, and became the ground for a long-continued
struggle between the Spanish and the Franco-Dutch
factions at Court. In the meantime, gradually 'the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
bitterness of the pill' of the Downs was 'sweetened'
by marriage negotiations, and the 'scandal' of the
infringement of the King's sovereignty over his own
waters was, if not forgiven, at least overlooked.</p>

<p>The King saw in fact that it was wiser to keep
silence. Spain was clearly a broken reed, and the
Dutch had given a signal proof of their possession
of a naval strength that it would be dangerous to
challenge. Sommelsdijk was quite content on his part
to let the matter drop. On February 8, 1646, he
wrote to the Stadholder<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'The scandal of the Downs has been so thoroughly
justified, that the greater part of the Council, in the
presence of the King, has sustained that we both
could and were obliged to do it; so it is sufficiently
lulled to sleep, seeing that up to now there has not
been made any further complaint. As long as I remain
I will take good care that neither on one occasion nor
another shall it be revived.'<a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And two days later (February 10) he wrote again:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'It is not our business to stir up again the affair of
the Downs. If we were to press for an answer, it
could be none other than condemnation after so much
noise and menaces; silence then must suffice us, as
a kind of answer, in place of an open approval, which
neither the state of the time or of men's minds permits
one to hope.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Sommelsdijk had judged rightly that his mission, so
far as the matter of the Downs was concerned, had
achieved all the success that was necessary.</p>

<p>The truth is that Charles, though his pride had
been so deeply hurt by the destruction of the Spanish
fleet in the presence of an English squadron close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the English shore, was secretly displeased with the
Spaniards for having, so to speak, forced his hands in
the matter. It was generally assumed at the time,
and the statement has frequently been made in histories
since, that Charles was aware of the intention of the
Spanish admiral to make use of the anchorage at the
Downs, should it be necessary for him to seek a place
of refuge either from storms or hostile attacks, and
that he had previously given permission for him to do
so before the fleet left the Spanish harbours. This
was not the case. A dispatch<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> from the Secretary of
State, Windebank, to Sir Arthur Hopton, the English
ambassador at Madrid, dated September 29 (o.s.), that
is nearly three weeks after the arrival of Oquendo at
the Downs, is conclusive testimony to the contrary.
It runs as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'Your lordship's dispatch of the 3/13 September gives
account of a message delivered to you by the Secretary
of the Council of War in the King's [Philip IV] name,
that he was resolved to put his great fleet to sea for
the transportation of his forces to Dunkirk, with intention
to chastise the insolences of the French and
Hollanders; and thereupon desired his Majesty to
afford the fleet a good passage in his seas and accommodations
in his harbours, with supplies of the necessary
commodities, if it should happen to put into any of
them. These letters though they came in extraordinary
diligence, yet they arrived not until the fleet
had been here in the Downs some days. Now that so
great a force of near seventy vessels should put into
any of his Majesty's ports, with such numbers of men
of war, without his Majesty's leave at all, or so much
as his knowledge until they were actually in the ports,
besides the neglect and disrespect, is beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
articles of the peace, and gives occasion enough of
jealousy, and would no question be taken highly by
them, had his Majesty done the like within their
dominions. I am sure it has cast his Majesty into
some difficulties and jealousies with the French and
Hollanders, and what prejudice it may bring upon his
treaties with them is much to be apprehended. It is
very true that Don Alonso [the Spanish ambassador,
de Cardenas] gave some intimation when his Majesty
was in the North that some vessels were preparing in
Spain for the transportation of forces into Flanders,
and desired his Majesty would not take apprehension
at it, but that they might have a friendly reception
and treatment in his ports, as occasion should be
presented. But he spoke not of so great a number
nor such a strength; and it was to be presumed he
had meant no other than those English merchant ships
that first transported the 1,400 or 1,500 soldiers, and
were intercepted and visited by the Hollanders....
When the fleet was come in, notwithstanding they were
in distress, having been shrewdly torn and beaten by
only seventeen of the Holland ships in their first
encounter (a shameful thing, considering the number
of the Spanish ships and their vastness, and their
ostentation before to chastise both the French and
the Hollanders), they refused to do the usual duties by
striking to the King's ships; insomuch as Sir John
Pennington, our Vice-Admiral, was enforced to threaten
to shoot them, if they did it not, and then, after some
dispute and much unwillingness, it was yielded to.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Nothing can be more clear from this whole statement
of the situation than the two facts that the
Spaniards were not expected, and that they were unwelcome
guests.</p>

<p>Why then, it may well be asked, did Charles endure
their presence so long in English waters, when it was
known that the Dutch were collecting a great fleet in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the offing? or why, having endured, did he not take
steps to secure his guests from attack by a plain
declaration that any breach of neutrality would be
treated as a declaration of war and would be resisted
by the English admiral? It was because he hoped to
be paid for his protection. 'It must be money that
must carry the business', wrote Windebank to Hopton.
Charles in fact asked for £150,000 sterling, of which
£50,000 was to be paid at once; and the Cardinal
Infant was busily engaged in obtaining the required
sum from the Antwerp money-lenders, when the blow
fell and there ceased to be any longer a Spanish fleet
to protect. As a striking instance, however, of the
diplomatic double-dealing of the times, and one peculiarly
characteristic of Stuart policy, it may be mentioned
that a dispatch of the French ambassador, Bellievre,
dated October 9, testifies to the fact that the Queen
was at this very time in the name of the King promising
the French Government that, if they would consent to
the Palatine prince assuming command of the late Duke
Bernhard's army, 'le roi feroit tout ce que nous et
les Hollandois pourrons souhaiter en leur faveur contre
la flotte d'Espagne, sans néanmoins se déclarer ennemi,
en sorte toutefois que les Hollandois auroient lieu
d'entreprendre et de faire tout ce que bon leur
sembleroit.'<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Hence the explanation of Pennington's
inactivity. Charles was in reality far more angry that
Tromp had marred his prospects of striking a good
bargain with one or other of the belligerents than at
his venturing to infringe a neutrality which was actually
in the market. He had not reckoned on the Dutch
being able to put so formidable a fleet to sea in so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
short a time, or bold enough to strike home with such
tremendous energy and effect.</p>

<p>Charles, however, should not be altogether blamed
for not pursuing at this crisis of his reign a firmer and
more consistent policy. Scotland was in rebellion, and
he had no funds to raise an army strong enough to
restore order. He was face to face with seething disaffection
in England. In April, 1640, he found himself
compelled, after an interval of ten years, to summon
a Parliament in the hopes of obtaining a grant of supplies.
Supplies were refused until grievances were amended,
and the Short Parliament, as it was called, was dissolved
after sitting three weeks. The Long Parliament was
to meet in November. It is no wonder that in such
circumstances the King became a pure opportunist in
his conduct of foreign policy. His domestic troubles
and his financial bankruptcy made it exceedingly difficult
for him to steer a straightforward course. The
bitter pill of the battle of the Downs had to be
swallowed, however disagreeable it might be. It was
an accomplished fact, the results of which could not be
undone save by war against France and the States,
which was in 1640 absolutely impossible. His high
pretensions to the sovereignty of the seas, and his
claims to demand licences for the fisheries could no
longer be insisted upon, his whole interest and attention
henceforward were concentrated on the struggle with
his own subjects and the maintenance of his sovereign
rights within his own Kingdoms.</p>

<p>The proposal therefore for a marriage between the
young prince William of Nassau and one of the English
princesses was not unwelcome. The Princes of Orange
were not of royal rank, but they filled a position of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
much dignity and influence in the United Provinces,
that it was felt that a union between the families might
be advantageous to Charles in securing to him the
goodwill of the Dutch in the dangers and difficulties
which were thickening round his throne. William was
only fifteen years of age, and at first the hand of the
younger princess Elizabeth was proposed, that of the
Princess Royal being assigned to a Spanish Infant.
But Elizabeth was only five years old, the prospect of
a Spanish match fell through, and at last in February,
1641, it was arranged that Mary the Princess Royal
should be the bride.</p>

<p>The greater part of one of the volumes of the
archives of the House of Orange-Nassau, edited by
Groen van Prinsterer, is filled with the negotiations concerning
this marriage, and the study of the endless notes
and dispatches on the subject is replete with interest both
for the student of the manners of the times, and because
they contain many passages giving lifelike and
charming touches concerning the Court of Charles I and
Henrietta Maria, and their intimate domestic life. Here
it is not possible to treat the subject in greater detail.</p>

<p>The proposed marriage was very popular in England,
whose people saw in it the definite adhesion of the King,
after many tergiversations, to the Protestant cause. On
May 2, Prince William disembarked at Gravesend and
proceeded to London in great state to meet his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fiancée</i>.
He was convoyed from Holland by a strong squadron
under the command of Admiral Tromp; and was accompanied
by the special envoys, Brederode, Aerssen
van Sommelsdijk, Heenvliet, and the resident ambassador,
Joachimi. In their report to the Stadholder of
the reception (May 2, 1641), the envoys write:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>'We had to pass through so many people, it was
almost impossible to reach the Court, except for the
good order which was kept from street to street.
Your Highness could not imagine with what blessings
and acclamations his Highness was received, and we
would venture to say that not for a century has a
reception taken place in which great and small have
testified so much joy and satisfaction.'</p></blockquote>

<p>It was to be the last glimmer of brightness in the
life of Charles and Henrietta Maria. The boy and
girl, aged respectively fifteen and ten years, were
married in state on May 12, 1641, in the chapel at
Whitehall&mdash;a marriage destined to sorrow, but which
was to have such important results upon the future
relations of England and the United Provinces. Nine
years later William was suddenly cut off by an attack of
small-pox in the midst of a promising career. A week
after his death Mary gave birth to a son, who was to
be famous in history as William III, Prince of Orange
and King of England.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI: 1641-1653</h2>


<p>The marriage of the Princess Royal with the son of
Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, on May 12, 1641,
took place at an ominous time. Ten days later
Strafford was executed. There can be little or no
doubt, that the eagerness of the King and Queen for
the accomplishment of this union was due to the desire
to secure the goodwill of the Stadholder, and through
him of the States, in the troublous times which they
saw before them. It fulfilled two objects. It gave
satisfaction to the Puritan party in England as being
a Protestant alliance, and it was accompanied by secret
assurances on the part of Frederick Henry of friendly
support to the King in his coming conflict with his
subjects. These assurances, we may well believe, were
very guarded and strictly personal, for no one knew
better than the Stadholder the limitations of his actual
power. The following passage from a letter in the
hand of Sommelsdijk, written March 5 in the name of
the envoys to Frederick Henry, puts the matter very
clearly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'We have found so much frankness and affection
on the part of the King and Queen for the furtherance
of the marriage, that we have no fear in recommending
your Highness to hasten the departure of Monseigneur
the Prince your son, as much as possible, so as to put
everything in security; for their Majesties have resolved
to push forward without allowing themselves to be
stopped by any machinations to the contrary from
whatever part they come, and whatever they write to
you, upon the good faith and confidence of Mr. de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Heenvliet, remains secret without anything of it escaping
either here or there, for fear lest the cognizance
of it should come to the knowledge of the Parliament.'<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>William returned to Holland at the end of May
alone, leaving his child-bride for awhile in her parents'
home. But the Grand Remonstrance, the impeachment
of the five members, and other events now
followed in rapid succession, and soon it was seen that
the issues which divided King and Parliament admitted
of no accommodation by peaceful means. Heenvliet,
who was still in England, became the trusted confidant
of the distracted King and Queen, and his letters to
Frederick Henry at this time show how anxious Charles
was to avoid a civil war, if by any concessions that did
not utterly despoil him&mdash;'le dèpouiller tout-à-fait'&mdash;he
could come to terms with the Parliament. In private
interviews Henrietta Maria was urgent with Heenvliet
to use his good offices, and many times expressed
the hope that should matters come to an extremity
'the Prince would not allow the King to perish'. In
reply the Stadholder impressed upon their Majesties
not to have recourse to arms, for victory was uncertain.
A reconciliation on whatever terms could not but be
to the profit and advantage of the King. Unfortunately
such advice was already too late to be of any avail
(February, 1642).</p>

<p>At the beginning of March Henrietta Maria accompanied
the Princess Royal to Holland. Her real object
was to collect funds and to secure, if possible, the
active assistance of the Prince of Orange. She was
received with much distinction and magnificence, but
her thoughts were not upon the shows of state.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
Letter upon letter passed from her to the Stadholder
in his camp, begging him to help her in procuring
supplies of money, arms, men, and munitions of war for
her husband's service. She tried to borrow upon her
jewels, but the Jews would give her nothing without
the guarantee of the Prince. Lords Jermyn and Digby
hurried backwards and forwards upon her confidential
missions, and she had many interviews with Heenvliet,
with whom she had become so intimate during his
sojourn in London. What a picture of the feverish
state of anxiety to which her troubles had brought the
once gay and buoyant Henrietta Maria, is contained
in a report of one of her conversations with him sent
by Heenvliet to the Prince of Orange.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>'I confess that this interview has troubled me not a
little. The Queen did not speak to me on the subject
without trembling, and she kept asking me so piteously,
if there were not any hope that by any means your
Highness could be persuaded to assist her, that I am
still troubled at it.'</p></blockquote>

<p>Frederick Henry did his very best to give all the
help he could, both in his private and official capacity.
He allowed the English officers serving in his army to
return home and join the King's forces, where their services
were of great value. He gave the guarantee she
required for a loan upon the Crown jewels, he advanced
a considerable sum of money out of his private purse,
and he connived at arms and ammunition being secretly
bought and sent to England from Dutch ports; but he
was unable to promise any assistance from the States,
nor indeed could he venture even to suggest it. The
bulk of the Dutch people in the opening stages of the
Civil War took the side of the Parliament, more especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the Hollanders. The Prince's influence could
still command the support of a majority in the States-General,
but he, like all the Stadholders of his House,
had constantly to struggle with the opposition of the
aristocratic burgher-regents of the towns of Holland,
who controlled the States of that dominant province.
Maurice had crushed by force in 1618 the attempt
of Oldenbarneveldt to claim for each province of the
Union independent sovereign rights, but the spirit of
Oldenbarneveldt survived, and the Hollanders, conscious
of the power of the purse that they possessed,
were ready to thwart the plans and policy of the
Stadholders, though these were supported by the other
provinces, and indeed did thwart them by raising difficulties
in the way of obtaining supplies. Frederick
Henry, during the first decade of his Stadholderate,
exercised a larger personal authority in the direction of
the affairs of the Republic than any of his predecessors
or successors. But during the last years of his life,
prematurely worn out by constant campaigning, he had
continually to confront the bitter opposition of the
town corporations of Holland to that vigorous prosecution
of the war that he desired. The Prince of Orange
then was not his own master, and could not in face of
the strong leanings of a large part of the population, in
Holland particularly, towards the Parliamentary cause
in the Civil War give effect to his own inclination to
lend the King active support in his efforts to suppress
rebellion by armed force.</p>

<p>Matters came to a crisis when, at the end of August,
a special envoy from the Parliament, Walter Strickland,
appeared at the Hague with instructions to protest
against the dispatch of warlike stores to the King from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Dutch ports, and the permitting of officers in the Dutch
service to join his army. The Queen was highly indignant.
The English resident ambassador, Boswell, at
her bidding immediately presented himself before the
States-General to protest and demand that Strickland
should not be received or acknowledged. To the Prince
she wrote, September 6, 1642, begging him to prevent
such an affront being offered to the King, 'for assuredly',
to quote her actual words, 'it would be so great, that
he could never have any friendship with these States
after this; and, God be thanked, he is not yet in such
a state as to be despised.' But although the majority
of the States-General were ready to refuse Strickland
any audience, they were forced by the insistance of the
States of Holland to make a compromise. They would
not admit him to the assembly of the States-General,
but they agreed to send two deputies to confer with him.
The result was, again by the pressure of Holland, that
the States-General declared for strict neutrality, and
forbade the export to either side in the Civil War of
arms or munitions of war. Despite this prohibition,
by the connivance of the Stadholder, friends of the
royal cause contrived to dispatch ammunition and
other stores to Dunkirk, and from thence to ship it to
England. Strickland, having heard of this, ventured
to make a written complaint to the States-General of
the Prince's conduct. Frederick Henry thereupon declared
that such an aspersion was an insult to his person
and demanded satisfaction. The States-General, May 7,
1643, declared thereupon the accusation of Strickland
to be false, and broke off all relations with him.</p>

<p>Henrietta Maria had returned to England the previous
February, never ceasing to the end her tireless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
efforts on her husband's behalf. Before leaving she
had broached the project of a second alliance between
the families, that of the Prince of Wales with the eldest
daughter of the Stadholder. It was not a mere ephemeral
project, for the following year a certain Dr. Goff,
who had been chaplain to one of the English regiments
in the Dutch service, was sent over by the Queen, with
a letter in which she says 'from me you will only know
that the King my lord has given me full and authentic
powers to negotiate and to conclude the marriage of my
son the Prince of Wales with Mademoiselle d'Orange.'
With these powers Dr. Goff was entrusted. In his
instructions were contained the onerous conditions,
which must be the price paid for the honour of such
a match. The States were to break with France unless
the latter would consent to give armed assistance to the
King, or in default of this to make peace with Spain,
one of the conditions of such a peace being a promise
of help to Charles. It is needless to say that the proposal
was not acceptable, for the simple reason that
Frederick Henry had no power to comply with the
conditions, even if he had wished. The negotiations,
however, went on all through 1645, although the desperate
state of the King's affairs after the battle of
Naseby rendered any successful issue impossible.
Louise of Nassau became shortly afterwards the wife
of the Great Elector.</p>

<p>In 1644 two envoys, William Boreel and Jan van Rheede,
were sent to England to attempt to mediate between the
King and the Parliament. Their instructions, containing
fifty-seven articles, are dated October 6, 1643, but they
did not actually set out until January 15 following. They
had interviews with Lord Denbigh, Sir Harry Mildemay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
and Sir William Strickland, representing the Parliament,
and afterwards, February 19, an audience with the King
in the hall of Christ Church at Oxford. During the
whole of the year 1644 they remained in England, and
took part in the abortive negotiations of Uxbridge, which
came to an end February 22, 1645. It became now
evident to the ambassadors that they could do no further
good, more especially as the Parliament more and more
showed a disinclination to accept foreign mediation.
After farewell audiences they reached the Hague again,
May 4, 1645, and made their report to the States-General.
It was unfavourable to the attitude of the Parliament.
On being informed of this by their representative,
Strickland, who was again at the Hague, the Parliament
requested him to appear before the States-General and
offer a justification on their behalf in reply to Boreel
and Van Rheede. The States-General, by the votes of
Utrecht, Groningen, Zeeland, and Overyssel against
Holland, Gelderland, and Friesland, refused him admission,
while at the same time they permitted the King's
resident, Boswell, to appear in their assembly and
address them. The Parliament on this had their justification
printed in English and Dutch, and secretly distributed
throughout the Provinces. It was eagerly read,
the mass of the people being in favour of what they
regarded as the cause of civil and religious freedom
against despotic rule, especially as there were many
points of resemblance between the struggle in England
and their own long drawn out struggle against Spanish
tyranny. This marked division of opinion in the Netherlands
effectually prevented any further steps being
taken to interfere in English affairs during the two
next years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Events, however, had been moving fast during that
interval. On March 14, 1647, Frederick Henry died.
At the very end of his life he had deserted the French
alliance, of which he had so long been a strong advocate,
and had joined his great influence to that of the Province
of Holland in bringing about a separate peace with
Spain. With the increasing growth of the military
strength of France, the project of a division of the
Spanish Netherlands with that power ceased to have
attractions for him. At the time of his death all the
conditions of peace with Spain had been practically
settled, the terms being virtually those dictated by the
Dutch. By the treaty which was actually signed at
Munster, January 30, 1648, Spain, after eighty years of
strife, was at last compelled to recognize the independence
of the United Provinces, and all the conquests
made by Frederick Henry in Flanders, Brabant, and
Limburg remained in the hands of the Dutch, as prizes
of war. At this proud moment in commerce, in sea-borne
trade, in finance, in colonial expansion and enterprise,
in arts and in letters, the Dutch Republic had
reached the zenith of its prosperity. The Civil War in
England had paralysed the energies of its chief rival
upon the seas, and left the way clear for the United
Provinces to step into the very first rank of maritime
powers.</p>

<p>Frederick Henry was succeeded in his posts and
dignities by his son. William II, Prince of Orange, had
only reached his twenty-second year at the time of his
father's death, but he was full of talent and energy, fired
with ambition, eager to emulate the great deeds of his
ancestors, and, if possible, to excel them. His wife,
Mary of England, was still a girl. Haughty in manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
and exceedingly tenacious of her royal rank, she preferred
always to be styled the Princess Royal, rather
than Princess of Orange. The relations between the
youthful pair were, however, thoroughly sympathetic,
and William was ever ready to lend a helping hand to
his English relations and never made any secret of his
zeal in their cause. His hospitality to them was unbounded,
and his purse open. First, the Duke of York
made his escape from England to Holland, April, 1648,
and he was followed by the Prince of Wales in July.
As the Queen of Bohemia was still residing at the Hague
with her daughters, quite a family party were assembled
at the Court of William and Mary. The Prince of
Wales, who was courteously received by a deputation
of the States-General, found a loyal squadron assembled
at Hellevoetsluys, of which he assumed command. He
also raised some troops for his service in the islands of
Borkum and Juist. There was at one time danger of a
collision in Dutch waters between the royal ships and
a Parliamentary squadron under the Earl of Warwick.
The Parliament dispatched an envoy, Dr. Doreslaar,
a native of Enkhuysen, who had settled in England and
had become Professor of History at Cambridge, to protest
against the protection and assistance accorded to
the royalists. The States-General refused to grant him
an audience. Towards the close of the year, Walter
Strickland was again sent to the Hague, furnished with
fresh credentials, to join Dr. Doreslaar and demand in
the name of the Parliament that the royal fleet should
not be furnished with arms and stores in Dutch harbours.
He was escorted by Lord Warwick, with a fleet of
twenty-one ships. The States-General took steps to
prevent a hostile encounter between the rival fleets, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
could not be moved even to give a hearing to the
Parliament's request. The States of Holland, however,
received Doreslaar, and passed a resolution forbidding
the royal ships and stores to remain in the harbours
of that province.</p>

<p>The news of the impending trial of Charles I for
high-treason caused consternation in the States, and
especially in Orangist circles. The Prince of Wales
himself, who had now handed over the command of
his fleet to Prince Rupert and was residing with his
brother-in-law at the Hague, appeared in person before
the States-General to ask them to intercede for his
father. All parties concurred in granting his request,
and it was unanimously resolved that an extraordinary
embassy should be sent to London, and in order to
strip it of any appearance of partisanship, the chosen
envoy was not an Orangist, but Adrian Pauw, lord of
Heemstede, the veteran leader of the Aristocratic-Hollander
party. With him was associated Albert
Joachimi, who through the whole of the Civil War
had remained at his post, as resident ambassador in
London. Besides his credentials, Pauw carried with
him letters for Fairfax, Cromwell, and other Parliamentary
leaders. The embassy was received with
courtesy Feb. 5/Jan. 26, 1649, and Pauw pressed for
an immediate audience. It was too late. On the
following day the death sentence was pronounced.
The envoys now approached, Sunday, Feb. 7/Jan. 28,
Fairfax, Cromwell, and others privately, asking for
a respite of the sentence, but failed to get any definite
answer. On the Monday they were granted an
audience at a special sitting of the House of Commons,
and in the name of the States-General, Pauw and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Joachimi read an address interceding for the King's
life, and setting out the reasons for the course for
which they were pleading. A general answer was
given, that what they had said should be considered.
In reality the decision had already been taken for
the public execution of the King the next morning,
Tuesday, Feb. 9/Jan. 30. The ambassadors had their
address translated from French into English, and on
seeing the preparations in Whitehall, again made an
effort to obtain an immediate audience, but they found
the way barred by troops, and knew that the object of
their mission could no longer be achieved.</p>

<p>Not till February 25/15 was an official answer given
to Pauw and Joachimi, in which, after thanking the
States for their friendly intentions, the Parliament
declined to discuss the question of the King's execution.
But at the same time an earnest desire was expressed
for the establishment of a firm peace, a right understanding
and good correspondence between the governments
of the two countries, which had so many common
interests. 'We shall', they said, 'be ever ready not
only to hear but to contribute with them all good
means and offices to fulfil such works as shall be
necessary for the general good of Christendom, as well
as our own.' There can be no doubt that Cromwell's
influence may be seen in this friendly overture.
Cromwell had already given Pauw an assurance in
a private interview of his wish for the establishment
of close relations of friendship with the Dutch, and
had spoken of a proposal being made for giving the
Netherlanders the same commercial privileges in
England as the inhabitants of the country. Already
there was floating before his eyes that idea, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
was afterwards in a position to try and realize, of
effecting such a close union between the two republics
as would make them into one State.</p>

<p>In 1649 any thought of such a thing was a mere
dream. The news of the King's execution caused
a wave of horror and indignation to sweep over the
Netherlands without distinction of class or party.
The States-General decided unanimously to offer their
condolences to the Prince of Wales and also to congratulate
him on his accession. The Orangists would
have liked his full title to have been given to him of
King of Great Britain and Ireland, but the States of
Holland and Zeeland, who were the most interested
in trade and shipping, opposed this, as they were
afraid of the resentment of the new government in
England. So it was agreed that he should be addressed
simply as King Charles II. To this title he had an
undoubted right, as he had been proclaimed king in
Scotland on his father's death. The States of Holland
separately also sent a deputation to him for the same
purpose. The number of broadsheets and pamphlets
that issued from the press are a proof of how deeply
moved the whole country was at the tragic death of
the English King. What was most remarkable was
the fact recorded by Clarendon<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> as to the change of
attitude among the preachers, who had hitherto been
strongly on the side of the Parliament. 'The body of
the clergy', he writes, 'in a Latin oration delivered
by the chief preacher of the Hague, lamented the
misfortune in terms of as much asperity, and detestation
of the actors, as unworthy the name of Christians,
as could be expressed.' Nevertheless, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
avoid an open breach with the Commonwealth, as it
was now styled, Joachimi was allowed to remain, as
the States' resident ambassador in London.</p>

<p>The English Council of State, on their part, determined
to send over once more Dr. Isaac Doreslaar to
join Strickland at the Hague, with instructions to propose
to the States-General the knitting together in
closer relations of the common interests of the two
countries. He arrived May 9. Doreslaar was especially
hateful to the royalists, who were gathered at that
time in large numbers in the Dutch capital, as he had
taken part in the King's trial, and rumour had even
designated him as the masked headsman. It was an
unhappy choice, which had serious consequences.
Three days after his arrival, Doreslaar, as he sat at
table in his hotel, was attacked by five or six men, and
assassinated. The assassins, their work accomplished,
walked off undisturbed. The body was sent back to
England, and was honoured with a public interment in
Westminster Abbey. 'Though all who were engaged
in this enterprise', writes Clarendon, 'went quietly
away, and so out of the town, insomuch as no one of
them was ever apprehended or called in question, yet
they kept not their own counsel so well (believing they
had done a very heroic act) but that it was generally
known that they were all Scottish men, and most of them
servants or dependents upon the Marquis of Montrose.'</p>

<p>The States of Holland, as soon as news reached
them of what had happened, made great efforts to
track the murderers, but in vain, and Joachimi was
commissioned to express their horror at the act, and
to try and appease the Parliament. The Parliament,
on their side, did not feel themselves sufficiently secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to take decisive action, and Strickland was instructed
to approach the States-General once more with offers
of friendship. But the influence of the Prince of
Orange in the States-General was paramount, and
Strickland was refused an audience. On the other
hand, despite Strickland's protest, the Scottish envoy,
Macdowell, sent by Charles II to announce his accession
to the throne of the northern kingdom, was received
by them. The English Council of State were unable
to regard this conduct in any other light than as
a deliberate insult to them and their representative.
Strickland was recalled, and Joachimi was informed
that unless he was provided with fresh letters of credit
to the Republican Government within a fixed time he
must leave the land. Strickland left Holland, July 22,
1650. Joachimi received orders to quit London,
September 26. All this time the States of Holland
had been doing their utmost to effect an accommodation.
The trade interests of the province with England
were so great that they were most anxious to avoid
a breach with the new Commonwealth. They on
their own authority received Strickland in a public
audience, and even ventured so far as to send a commissary,
Gerard Schaep by name, to London, January 22.
This high-handed act of independence only had the
effect, however, of stiffening the backs of the States-General.
All the efforts of Holland to change their
attitude towards England failed.</p>

<p>The acute differences of view in regard to this
particular line of policy between the self-willed province
and the Stadholder were but the signs of a general
estrangement; and the struggle for predominance was
destined to come to a head at the very time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
return of Joachimi. The Prince of Orange had been
altogether opposed to the abandonment of the French
alliance and the conclusion of a separate treaty with
Spain in 1648. The peace of Munster had carried
into effect the policy of the States of Holland, and
William II was determined, as soon as he got the
reins of power firmly into his hands, to reverse it.
He entered into secret negotiations with Mazarin for
a renewal of a French alliance against Spain, with the
aim of conquering and partitioning the Spanish Netherlands.
Devotedly attached to the Stuart cause, it was
his intention with French help to try to overthrow the
English Commonwealth and establish Charles II on
his father's throne. His generosity to his wife's exiled
relations was so great that he impoverished himself
and had to raise large loans on his estates. With
ambitious schemes of war and conquest filling his brain,
he found himself speedily in disagreement with the
merchant burghers of the Province of Holland. The
chief interest of the Hollanders was peace, which would
reduce taxation and increase commerce. They had
long grudged the heavy charges of the war, and the
Provincial States, as soon as peace was concluded,
clamoured for the disbanding of a large number of
the regiments, which, though they formed part of the
federal army, were in the pay of the Province of
Holland. William, as Captain-General of the Union,
opposed this, and was supported by the States-General.
Into the details of this contest for supremacy it is
needless to enter here. It was to a certain extent
a repetition of that between Maurice and Oldenbarneveldt.
Armed with the authority of the States-General,
William in the summer of 1650, at the head of a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
body of troops, forced the States of Holland to submission.
In the previous year Charles, on his departure
for Scotland, had begged the support of the States-General,
and had promised in return to settle favourably
the long-standing differences about Amboina
and Pulo Run in the East Indies, and other questions,
but owing to the opposition of Holland and
Zeeland no active assistance was given. The States-General,
however, as a mark of sympathy and goodwill,
assembled in a body to bid him farewell. The
royal cause had at first prospered in Scotland, until
September 13/3, 1650, when the battle of Dunbar
shattered Charles's fair prospects. But at this very
time his brother-in-law had just brought his contest
with the Province of Holland to a triumphant issue.
William II was now in a position to bring about that
active intervention of the States in alliance with France
in support of the Stuart cause, and for the expulsion
of the Spaniards from the Southern Netherlands, on
which his heart was set. To the Prince of Orange
therefore the eyes of the English royalist party were
turned, as their chief hope in the hour when it seemed
as if nothing could stem the tide of Cromwell's victories.
They were doomed to a terrible disappointment.
William, in the very midst of secret negotiations with
France, suddenly fell sick of the small-pox, and after
a week's illness died, November 6, 1650. He was
but twenty-four, and in him Charles II lost a chivalrous
and true-hearted friend. Eager for fame, gifted with
uncommon abilities, William, had he lived, was undoubtedly
prepared to have put his far-reaching plans
into execution, and to have risked much for the upholding
of his kinsman's rights.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>His decease brought about a revolution in the
United Provinces. He left no one of his family to take
his place. His only child was not born until a week
after his death. The Province of Holland straightway
seized the opportunity to assert that predominance
in the Union for which it had been striving so long.
Its leaders at once took steps to call an extraordinary
assembly, known as the 'Great Gathering', to take
into consideration the state of the Union, of religion,
and military affairs. The Great Gathering met at
the Hague, January 18, 1651. The office of Stadholder
was abolished, in all the provinces but Friesland, as
were also the posts of Captain-General and Admiral-General
of the Union. The population and the wealth
of Holland gave henceforth to the States of that
province a position of supremacy in the federation,
and, as in the days of Oldenbarneveldt, all the threads
of administration and the conduct of foreign affairs
passed during the Stadholderless period into the hands
of its chief functionary, the <i>Raad-Pensionaris</i> or Grand
Pensionary.</p>

<p>This complete change in the system of government
of the United Provinces caused much satisfaction in
London. The aristocratic burgher oligarchy, who were
now in power at the Hague, had no special sympathy
for Charles II. Indeed it was embittered against him
at this time, since Prince Rupert's ships from their
head-quarters in the Scilly Islands had been plundering
Dutch merchantmen in their passage up channel. The
Parliament therefore determined to send a special
embassy to propose that close alliance between the
two neighbouring republics, almost amounting to a
political union, which Cromwell had already set before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
him as an end to be aimed at for the mutual advantage
of both States. The States-General on their side had,
on the proposal of the States of Holland, determined,
January 28, 1651, to recognize the English Commonwealth
as a free republic, and to receive its envoys,
and Joachimi again went to London to take up his old
post as the resident ambassador of the States.</p>

<p>The English ambassadors were Oliver St. John
and Walter Strickland, the latter of whom, as we have
seen, had spent many years in Holland without being
able to obtain an audience with the States-General.
The Parliament were now determined that their representatives
should make their state entry into the
Hague with a splendour befitting the envoys of so
mighty a power. They were accompanied by a suite
of some 250 persons in brilliant uniforms and liveries,
and travelled in twenty-five state coaches. On
March 27, 1651, the solemn entry took place. The
ambassadors were, however, to pass through the ordeal
of an unpleasant experience. As the procession made
its way through the crowded streets, St. John and
Strickland were greeted with loud cries of 'Regicides',
'Executioners', 'Cromwell's bastards', and other
abusive epithets. No doubt there were many royalist
refugees in the Hague, but though these may have
given the lead to the mob, there can be little question
of the general hostility at this time of the masses of
the people, even in Holland itself, to the Parliament.
It is a common mistake to suppose that the Orangist
was the aristocratic, the republican, or so-called
'States' party, the popular party in the United Provinces.
The States of Holland, which was the stronghold
of the republican party, was entirely in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hands of the close oligarchic corporations of the chief
towns of the province. In each town a few aristocratic
burgher families monopolized all offices and authority,
the rest of the townsmen had no votes or representation,
and the country people were ignored altogether.
The great influence and executive powers of the
Stadholders of the house of Orange were therefore
a check upon the domination of these burgher oligarchies,
and so by them resented accordingly. On
the other hand, the Princes of Orange were loved and
respected by the people, alike for their high qualities
and the great services they had rendered to the
country, and there was scarcely any time when they
had not the enthusiastic support of the great majority
of those classes, the bulk of the population, who were
excluded from any share in the government of the
State. A knowledge of these facts is absolutely
necessary to a right understanding of what the 'Stadholderless'
régime in the time of John de Witt really
meant.</p>

<p>The parliamentary ambassadors were really alarmed,
remembering the fate of Doreslaar, at this hostile
reception. Neither they nor their attendants dared to
venture into the streets but in parties of five or six and
sword in hand; and everywhere they were followed by
the cry of 'Regicides'. On March 29, St. John and
Strickland presented their credentials before the 'Great
Gathering', and in a long speech expressed the desire of
the English Government for the establishment of good
relations of enduring friendship between the two republics.
'It is the wish of the Parliament to conclude',
they said, 'a closer union of the two States, which would
be for both more advantageous than heretofore, since it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
would not be dependent upon the life and will and
private interests of a single individual.' Six commissioners
were appointed by the Assembly to discuss
their proposals, and a conference was opened on April 4.
The grounds on which the English proposed to the
Netherlanders that 'a more strict and intimate Alliance
and Union bee entred into by them, whereby there
may bee a more intrinsecall and mutual interest of
each other, than hath hitherto beene for the good
of both', were: (1) community of religion, (2) community
of political liberty, (3) community of interest in freedom
of trade and navigation. The Dutch, however, showed
themselves very wary. They had no intention of
giving their consent to any general propositions before
informing themselves of their precise meaning. There
was considerable variety of opinion in the different
provinces and much indecision. On April 6, the commissioners
were only empowered to reply, that the
States were willing 'not only to renew the ancient
friendship between the two nations, but also to conclude
a treaty for common interests'. This response
did not satisfy the English envoys, who rejoined that
'the union for common interests' they had in view
'was one closer than at any previous time'. These
words required explanation, but it seemed that they
could only point to an alliance so intimate and binding
as to be another term for coalition. Such was indeed
its meaning in the minds of those who proposed it,
and so the Dutch interpreted it. To them, however,
not unnaturally, the only idea suggested by a coalition
with the English Commonwealth was the loss by the
smaller republic of its independence, and its practical
absorption in the larger. Such an idea was simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
unthinkable to men who had just won the recognition
of their independence after eighty years of heroic
struggle. The reply of the Assembly was not hurriedly
given. At last, on April 26, it came, and was so far
unsatisfactory that, while expressing their readiness for
a closer union, the reservation was made that it must
be one 'in which both States could better promote their
interests for themselves and for the common welfare'.
St. John and Strickland now went a step further, and
gave a hint that if an offensive and defensive confederation
such as they had in mind could be accomplished,
it would be accompanied by many advantageous
concessions to the Dutch. At this point the
negotiations came to an end. The Parliament did not
believe that in the present temper of the Dutch their
proposals were likely to be received in the spirit in
which they were offered, and the ambassadors were
recalled. They and their attendants were constantly
insulted by Royalists and Orangists whenever they
showed themselves out of doors, and though the provincial
authorities strictly forbade such outrages on
pain of severe penalties, and urged the citizens to
assist in the protection of the representatives of a
foreign power, they effected little. Some of the offenders
were of high rank<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, and they openly braved the
threats of the magistracy and remained unpunished.
Earnest representations were now made to the English
Parliament on behalf of the States of Holland by their
agent, Gerard Schaep, who was still residing in London,
that they would allow the envoys of the Commonwealth
to remain awhile longer and continue the negotiations.
The Parliament, however, would only consent to do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
on condition that full satisfaction be made to St. John and
Strickland for all that they had endured, and that the
attacks upon them should cease. The States of Holland
promised to do this. Prince Edward of the Palatine
and other prominent offenders were summoned before
a court of justice, and warned; some of their servants
were punished. It was a sorry piece of business. But
it was an index to the real feeling of the populace that
such a state of things should have been possible in a
town like the Hague.</p>

<p>The negotiations were accordingly renewed by the
presentation of fresh proposals, May 10, by St. John
and Strickland. There was now no mention of coalition,
only of an offensive and defensive alliance, but
there was an ominous addition: both States were
required to bind themselves severally not to permit
the sojourn on their soil of declared enemies of the
other. This was especially directed against the adherents
of the Stuarts and the members of the Orange
and Palatinate families. The great desire of the party
now in power in the Netherlands was the maintenance
of peace. The Hollanders were willing to conclude
a treaty extending their trade privileges, but they were
anxious not to be drawn into the war in Scotland, and
in face of the popular affection for the house of Orange
they dared not venture at the dictation of a foreign
power to treat the young prince and his mother
harshly. They responded therefore, after some delay,
by counter proposals for the renewal of the Treaty
of 1496, the <cite>Magnus Intercursus</cite>, but revised in favour
of the Dutch to suit present-day conditions. Complete
freedom of trade, navigation, and fishery without pass,
toll, or other hindrances in each other's domains was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
what was aimed at. No mention was made of the
English proposal to banish from the Netherlands those
who gave help to the Stuart cause. With such differences
of view there was of course no prospect of any
agreement being reached. The English embassy
accordingly left the Hague, July 31, 1651, and returned
home.</p>

<p>The report made to Parliament created a bad impression
in England, and led to all the old complaints
against the Dutch being raked up once more: the
massacre of Amboina, the seizure of Pulo Run and other
high-handed acts in the East Indies, their monopoly of
the fisheries on the British coasts, their attacks on the
English whalers off Spitzbergen, and their attempts to
drive out English trade from the Baltic, from Russia,
and elsewhere. Then on the top of this the shameful
treatment to which the parliamentary envoys had been
persistently exposed was angrily recalled, the refusal
of the States-General for years to admit Strickland to
an audience, the murder of Doreslaar, and lastly the
insults offered to the latest embassy. All these things
formed a formidable bill of indictment. As the efforts
of the Parliament to effect a close union between the
republics for their common interest had failed, it became
the clear duty of the English Government to take
measures to protect the national interests against unscrupulous
rivals. There was no delay in taking drastic
action.</p>

<p>On October 9, 1651, the famous Navigation Act was
passed, which forbade the importation of foreign goods
and products into English harbours save in English
bottoms, or those of the countries from whence the goods
and products came. A deadly blow was thus struck at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the Netherlanders, who had at that time almost a monopoly
of the most important branches of sea-borne trade
and were the carriers of the world. Scarcely less serious
was the prohibition to foreigners to fish in British waters.
Every infringement of this edict would be punished by
the confiscation of the offending vessels. It has already
been seen in previous lectures of what vital importance
these fisheries were to the welfare of Holland.</p>

<p>The States-General now determined to make a serious
effort to resume the negotiations which had been broken
off, and Jacob Cats, Gerard Schaep, and Paulus van
der Perre were sent on a special embassy to England.
They reached London, December 27. Their task was
a difficult one. They pressed for the revocation of the
Navigation Act and of the embargo upon fishing, and
for the release of the confiscated ships, and proposed
that negotiations should again be set on foot for the
conclusion of a treaty based upon the <cite>Magnus Intercursus</cite>.
The news at this critical moment that the
Dutch were fitting out 150 new war vessels for the
protection of free navigation did not tend to smooth
the way to an understanding. It was regarded in
England as a threat. The English now formulated
their demands. These were such as they must have
known would never be conceded. They required the
payment of the arrears of toll due for the fishing on
the British coasts, the surrender of the Spice Islands,
the punishment of the survivors of those concerned in
the Amboina massacre, satisfaction for the murder of
Doreslaar, and the payment of the indemnities due for
losses sustained by Englishmen at the hands of the
Dutch in various parts of the world. It is clear that
these demands were practically an ultimatum. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Netherlanders were required to choose between coalition
or humiliation, and in case neither were accepted,
war. Both sides were, however, averse to taking the
final step, and conferences and negotiations still dragged
on for some months, while strenuous preparations were
at the same time being made on both sides of the
Channel for hostilities. It was a dangerous situation,
and was made wellnigh desperate by a conflict which
took place off Folkestone, May 19, 1652, between the
Dutch fleet under Tromp and an English squadron
under Blake, through a misunderstanding about the
question of striking the flag. This event excited public
opinion in England to fever pitch, and made war practically
inevitable. The Dutch Government, however,
knew that they were not prepared for such a mighty
conflict. The peace party in Holland had insisted on
the disbanding of a large part of the land forces after
the death of William, and the navy had been neglected
and was far from being as formidable as a few years
before. In all haste therefore the experienced Adrian
Pauw, now holding the important post of Grand Pensionary
of Holland, was sent over to London to join
Cats, Schaep, and van Perre, and endeavour even at
the last moment to avoid a final breach between the two
nations. His efforts proved vain, for the English would
not give way in their demands for conditions too humiliating
for the Netherlanders to accept. The 'States' party
in power had, in fact, not a free hand, even had they
been inclined to preserve peace at the cost of submission
to English dictation, for the Orangists were delighted
at the thought of trying conclusions with the
hated Commonwealth, and they had strong support
throughout the country. The fear of a revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
compelled the States-General to refuse the only terms
by which war could be avoided. The die was cast.
The Dutch ambassadors left England, June 30, and
the struggle between the two maritime powers for
supremacy, which had been so frequently imminent
but so long delayed, at last began.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>


<h3>A. <span class="smcap">The Great or Herring Fishery.</span></h3>

<p>From the nature of the land, Holland and Zeeland
were always the home of fisher-folk. The herring
fishery off the coast of Great Britain was from early
times an industry pursued by many Hollanders and
Zeelanders, but it was comparatively limited, until the
invention of 'curing' made by Willem Beukelsz of
Biervliet in the latter part of the fourteenth century
(he probably died in 1397) converted a perishable
article of food into a commercial commodity. The
method of Beukelsz, which remained practically unchanged
for some five centuries, without going into
minute particulars, consisted in the following processes.
Immediately after the hauling in of the nets the guts
were in a particular manner removed from the fish,
which were then packed in layers in barrels with salt
between the layers. In the brine or pickle that was
formed they were allowed to lie some time, fresh salt
being added every fortnight. At first the Zeelanders
were the chief herring fishers, but afterwards the towns
on the Zuyder Zee and on the Maas became the head-quarters
of the industry. During the Burgundian
period many laws were enacted regulating the herring
fisheries, but the edict<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> of Charles V, May 18, 1519,
which extended and codified all previous enactments,
remained the permanent basis of future legislation on
the subject. The chief regulations concerned the
branding of the barrels, the sorting of the fish, and
the date of the beginning of the fishing. This date
was originally August 24 (St. Bartholomew), but was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
afterwards changed first to July 25 (St. James), and
finally to June 24 (St. John the Baptist). It is possible
that some change in the habits of the herring shoals
may have led to this considerable shifting of the date.
After 1519 there were many fresh enactments made,
referring particularly to matters concerning convoys
and their cost, the duties levied, and many details in
regard to the boats, tackle, and crews, and again a codification
of all laws was carried out by a series of edicts in
1580, 1582, and 1584. These edicts of 1580 and 1582
(Groot Placaetboek van Holland en West Vriesland,
tom i., 684-691, 696-707, 715-727, 748-751), continued
to regulate the fisheries during the period with which
these lectures deal; i.e. the first half of the seventeenth
century. Especial attention was given in these regulations
to the branding of the barrels in which the herrings
were packed. Each fishing town had its official inspectors,
who themselves branded the barrels with the
mark of the cooper and that of the town, and no others
were allowed to be used. The kind of salt for the
curing was rigorously prescribed, and careful precautions
taken that no other kind or damaged salt was
smuggled on board. Not less minute were the regulations
to ensure that the quality of the fish which
came to the market should be guaranteed. All fish
had to be sorted. Such as were caught before July 25
(St. James), being not fully developed, had to be kept
apart. Such as were caught after July 25 had to be
divided according to technical categories, 'full and sweet',
'empty', 'undersized or damaged'; and the skipper was
enjoined under oath to place his own mark upon each
barrel and to be personally responsible for the quality
assigned, and not only so, the fisherman who packed
the fish in the barrel was required to place his mark
upon it. The most stringent rules were laid down as
the correct method of curing. In fact, everything was
done to show the importance of the industry, and the
necessity of securing that the market was supplied with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
no counterfeit article, but only with herrings prepared
in Dutch fashion by Dutch hands. In order to keep
a fast hold upon the monopoly, the fishermen were forbidden
under heavy penalties to sell their fish in foreign
ports. In the seventeenth century, the interests of those
engaged in this profitable trade were vigilantly looked
after by a body known as the 'College of the Great
Fishery', which met at Delft. The College consisted
of five deputies from the towns of Enkhuysen, Schiedam,
Delft, Rotterdam, and Brill, and so exclusive were they
that during the period with which we are concerned
other towns, even such important places as Amsterdam,
Dordrecht, and Hoorn, were refused admission. One
of the chief tasks of the College was to enforce the
carrying out of the regulations.</p>

<p>During the reigns of the two first Stuarts, the Dutch
fishing fleet was accustomed to sail out for the Scottish
waters between the Shetlands and Cape Buchan Ness
in the middle of June, so as to begin their fishing
operations on St. John's Day, June 24. From June 24
to July 25, the fishing was wholly in the north; from
July 25 to September 14 to the south of Buchan Ness,
but still along the Scottish coast; from September 25
to November 25 in the neighbourhood of Yarmouth;
from November 25 to January 31 off the mouth of the
Thames and the Kentish coast. The fleet sailed out
twice only, in June and again in the autumn, the task
of conveying the barrels of fish from the fishing
'busses' to the Dutch harbours being carried out by
a number of light vessels called 'ventjagers.' The
herring fleet was always accompanied by an armed
convoy, to the upkeep of which the State contributed
20,000 florins annually. In war time a small naval
squadron was also detached to keep watch and ward
against the attacks of Spanish cruisers and Dunkirk
pirates.</p>

<p>The Herring or Great Fishery was compulsorily
closed on January 31. During the spring months the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
fishermen occupied themselves with fishing by hook
on the Dogger Bank, for cod, soles, and other fish.
This was named 'The Small Fishery'.</p>


<h3>B. <span class="smcap">The Narrow Seas.</span></h3>

<p>The expression 'the Narrow Sea', or 'the Narrow
Seas', which so often appears in seventeenth-century
diplomatic dispatches and controversial writings, is a
term upon whose exact signification geographically
there has been much dispute. The English kings from
ancient times claimed 'sovereignty'&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dominium maris</i>&mdash;in
the 'narrow seas' or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mare britannicum</i>. Evidence
is fairly conclusive that the term under the Tudors and
until the friction with the Dutch arose on the questions
of free fishery and the striking of the flag in the reign
of James I, was confined to the Channel, the narrow
sea between England and France. Lord Salisbury, as
late as 1609, writing to Sir R. Winwood at the Hague
(Winwood, <cite>Mem.</cite> iii, p. 50), speaks of 'his Majesty's
narrow seas between England and France, where the
whole appertayneth to him in right, and hath been
possessed tyme out of mind by his progenitors.' It
soon, however, became the accepted interpretation of
English statesmen, jurists, and writers that the 'narrow
seas' meant the two seas between England and France,
and England and the Netherlands; thus Rapin (<cite>Hist.
d'Angleterre</cite> vii, p. 454), 'la domination des deux Mers,
c'est-à-dire, des deux bras de Mer qui se trouvent entre
l'Angleterre et la France et entre l'Allemagne et la
Grande-Bretagne.' This extension of the term was
vigorously contested by the Dutch. In the peace negotiations
at Cologne in 1673 the Dutch protested that
no treaty between England and any other power 'n'ait
meslé la Mer Britannique avec celle du septentrion'
(<cite>Verbaal der Amb.</cite> 1673/74). The English popular
view of the question appears clearly in an anonymous
pamphlet, <cite>The Dutch Drawn to the Life</cite>, published<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
in 1664, just before the outbreak of the Second Dutch
War. The writer speaks of 'the command of the Narrow
Sea, the Dutch coast and ours' (p. 53); and again, referring
to the action taken by King Charles I in 1640 (p. 148),
'When our neighbours the Dutchmen minded their
interest and were almost Masters at Sea in the Northern
Fishing ... upon our Fishmongers' complaint the
King encouraged several overtures and projects concerning
Busses for our own Coasts service, the prevention
of strangers, and the improvement of the Narrow
Seas, &amp;c.'</p>


<h3>C. <span class="smcap">The Jülich-Cleves Succession Question.</span></h3>

<p>The death of John William (March 9, 1609), the mad
Duke of Jülich-Cleves, without issue, raised the important
question of the succession to his territory, which lay
astride the Rhine on the eastern frontier of the United
Provinces. It was felt to be essential for the protection
of Protestant interests in Germany and the Netherlands
that the Duchies should not fall into the hands of a
partisan of the house of Habsburg. Duke John William
had four sisters, but only the claims of the descendants
of the two eldest really counted. Maria Eleanora had
married Duke Albert Frederick of Prussia. All her
sons, however, had died young, but it was held that her
claims had passed to the son of her daughter Anna, who
had married John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg.
This was disputed by the Count Palatine, Philip Lewis
of Neuburg, who had married the second sister of the
deceased duke, also named Anna. Eventually the Elector
and the Count Palatine agreed to occupy the disputed
territory jointly, and were known as 'the Possessors'.
The Dutch recognized the title of 'the Possessors', but
the Emperor Rudolph refused to do so, and with his
sanction the Archduke Leopold, Bishop of Passau, at the
head of an armed force, made his way into the Duchies
and seized the fortress of Jülich. Henry IV of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
who had been meditating an expedition for the overthrow
of the Habsburg power, seized the opportunity
for planning a great alliance with the Dutch, James I
of England, and the Protestant princes of Germany for
the expulsion of the Archduke and the recovering of
Jülich. His assassination, May 14, 1610, put an end
to his ambitious schemes, but though deprived of the
help of a great French army, Maurice of Nassau, at the
head of a considerable force of Dutch and English troops,
entered the Duchies and was joined by the troops of the
'Possessing' princes. On September 1, Jülich surrendered,
and Archduke Leopold left the territory. The
troubles were not, however, yet over. The 'Possessors',
as perhaps might have been expected, quarrelled. John
Sigismund of Brandenburg became a Calvinist, Wolfgang
William of Neuburg married the sister of the
Duke of Bavaria, and announced his conversion to
Catholicism. In September, 1614, Maurice of Nassau,
with Dutch troops, and Spinola at the head of a Spanish
force, both entered the Duchies, and a hostile encounter
seemed inevitable. Hostilities were, however, avoided,
and by the treaty of Xanten (November 12) the two
rivals agreed to a partition of the territory.</p>


<h3>D. <span class="smcap">The Origin and Early History of the Fellowship
of the Merchant Adventurers.</span></h3>

<p>The Fellowship of Merchant Adventurers has the
distinction of holding the first place, not only in England,
but in Western and Central Europe, as the pioneer of
great trading corporations. The Gilds of the Middle
Ages were municipal and local institutions. The Hansa
League in Germany was a bond, not between merchants
dealing in particular wares, but between a group of towns.</p>

<p>England in the fourteenth century had no manufactures.
Her only industries were cattle-breeding and
agriculture; her exports were raw materials, chiefly wool.
English wool was famed for its quality, and was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sought after by the cloth weavers of the Netherlands,
Germany, and Italy. The trade was almost entirely in
the hands of the Hansa and of Italians, who sent over
agents to England to buy up the wool and export it to
the Continent. In England itself, before a.d. 1300, the
sale of the best wool, that of the royal flocks and of the
great landowners, was conducted under the royal licence
by an official body or group of merchants, known as
'Merchants of the Staple'. A Staple (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">stabile emporium</i>)
was a place set apart for the export and import of certain
articles; and there were ten or a dozen English towns,
known as Staple Towns&mdash;among them Newcastle, York,
Norwich, Westminster, and Bristol&mdash;where alone the wool
traffic could be carried on. Also on the Continent there
was a Staple Town, which was the recognized centre of
the foreign trade, having exclusive rights. No wool
could legally be shipped from England to any other
port. During almost the whole of the fourteenth century
the Staple was at Bruges. The institution by
Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, of the famous
Order of the Golden Fleece, at Bruges in 1430, had a
direct reference to the English wool, which had so much
contributed to the town's prosperity. By that date, however,
a change had already taken place in England.
Flemish refugees had, during the troubled times of the
Arteveldes, fled across the Channel, taking with them
their skill in the textile industries. Many of them settled
at Norwich, then one of the Staple towns, and introduced
the art of cloth-weaving. Only the coarser fabrics,
rough white cloths, baize, and kersey, were produced,
and these were sent over to Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, and
other places, to be finished and dyed. To a monopoly
of this trade the Staple Company, which had in 1359
removed from Bruges to Calais, had no claim, and the
exporting of cloth fell into other hands. Enterprising
English traders, under the name of Merchant Adventurers,
had already begun to visit foreign countries with
their wares, the pioneers of a commerce which was one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
day to encircle the world. Their first official recognition
came from the Kings of the house of Lancaster. By a
letter patent of Henry IV, 1407, they were granted the
privilege of appointing a governor or consul to represent
them in certain towns, where they traded. Their consolidation
into an organized society appears to have
been a gradual process, and little is known of the actual
steps by which the court or central governing body of
the Merchant Adventurers came into being, but in the
middle of the fifteenth century it was in existence, and
at the same time Antwerp became the port to which
exclusively their goods were sent and from which they
were distributed to other parts of the continent&mdash;in other
words, their Staple. At Antwerp a wharf, warehouse,
and dwellings were erected for their use, and extensive
privileges granted to them, including a certain autonomous
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The Charter which constituted them into an organized
corporation was granted by Henry VI in 1462.
By this Charter the Fellowship obtained the monopoly
of the trade in woollen goods, at least all traders who
were not members of the Fellowship had to pay a tax
for their privilege, low at first, but which at the end of
the century had risen so high as to be practically prohibitive.
By this Charter the right of jurisdiction at
Antwerp was confirmed and placed in the hands of
a court consisting of a governor and twelve assistants,
the governor being appointed by the King, the assistants
elected by the members. Shortly after the
granting of this Charter the activity of the Adventurers
at Antwerp aroused the hostility of the Flemish
weavers, and Duke Philip the Good was induced by
their complaints to forbid in 1464 the importation of
English woollen goods into his dominion. They had
therefore for awhile to withdraw to Utrecht. On
Philip's death in 1467 the interdict was removed, and
Antwerp again became the Staple of the Adventurers,
and was to be their home for wellnigh two centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The period of the greatest prosperity of the Fellowship
was the sixteenth century, the period of the
Tudors. This prosperity was built up on the privileges
and monopoly granted to them by the Charter
of Henry VII in 1501, which was extended in 1505
and remained in force until the reign of James I.
The governing body consisted of a governor and
twenty-four assistants, elected by the 'General Court',
as the whole assembly of members was styled. This
governing body had extensive powers, legislative, executive,
and judicial. Their jurisdiction over the
members was not confined to civil actions, but they
had the power of inflicting heavy fines and even
imprisonment for criminal offences. To become a
member&mdash;'a free and sworn brother'&mdash;of the Fellowship
an apprenticeship of not less than eight years had
to be served, except in the case of sons of members;
and proof had to be given of English birth and
parentage. A 'brother' who married a foreigner or
acquired foreign property was disqualified.</p>

<p>Four times a year the ships of the Fellowship
gathered at London and sailed to Antwerp, carrying
a cargo of half-finished white cloths, kerseys, and
baize. The merchants themselves had to accompany
their goods, for it was prescribed 'that every one must
sell his own wares'. These sales could only take
place in the Court-house, and only three times a
week, on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The
carrying out of these regulations and jurisdiction within
the Staple was entrusted to a secondary governing
body or court consisting, like the head body in London,
of an elected governor and assistants. The great
rival of the Adventurers had been the Staple Company
and the Hansa League, but both these bodies
became in the sixteenth century decadent, and with
the capture of Calais in 1558 the Staple Company
ceased to exist. But though the loss of Calais made
Antwerp more than ever the centre of the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
continental trade, troubles were in store for the
Merchant Adventurers.</p>

<p>With the accession of Elizabeth disputes arose between
the English and Spanish Governments about
the interpretation of the treaty of commerce, known
as the <cite>Magnus Intercursus</cite>, concluded in 1496 between
Henry VII and Philip the Fair. Margaret of
Parma, the Governor of the Netherlands, took in 1563
the strong step of forbidding the entrance of English
goods into the Netherlands. Elizabeth replied by
closing the English harbours to ships from the Netherlands.
For about a year this state of things spelt
ruin to the Adventurers, but no less so to Antwerp.
In 1564, accordingly, an understanding was reached,
and the Court once more returned to its old quarters
on the Scheldt. But for a brief space only. The
outbreak of the Revolt led to the banishment of the
Adventurers from the Netherlands, and at the end
of 1564 they left Antwerp finally.</p>

<p>Shut out from the Netherlands, the Fellowship now
tried to set up their Staple further north in the region
dominated by their chief rivals the Hansa League.
At first they found a resting-place at Emden, but in
1567 they were tempted by an invitation from Hamburg
to set up their Court in that great seaport, from whence
by the Elbe they had access to the German market.
Hamburg thus played for its own profit the part of
traitor to the League, of which it was one of the foremost
members. The residence at Hamburg lasted ten
years, but the bitter opposition of the Hansa to their
presence proved too strong, and by an Imperial decree
of Rudolph II they were in 1577 banished from German
soil. The energies of the Adventurers were now
diverted into different channels, small factories being
placed at Stade, Emden, and even at Elbing near
Dantzic. A more important move was the attempt to
re-enter the Netherlands by the erection of a subsidiary
court at Middelburg in 1582. Holland and Zeeland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
had now practically freed themselves from Spanish rule,
and Middelburg, on the island of Walcheren, was the
capital of Zeeland, and at that time a flourishing port.
With the growth of the United Provinces in power
and wealth, it was clearly the best policy of the Fellowship
to establish its chief Staple and Court within the
boundaries of the Republic. There were many claimants,
among them Groningen, Delft, and Rotterdam. But
after many negotiations, an influential deputation sent
by Middelburg in January, 1598, to London, decided
the choice of the English Government and of the
General Court of the Adventurers in favour of making
this town their sole Staple upon the Continent, and the
seat of their Great Court. Many points concerning
the rights and privileges to be enjoyed, together with
the restrictions imposed, were the subject of much discussion
before the terms of the agreement was finally
settled between the town of Middelburg, the States of
Zeeland, and the States-General on the one hand, and
the English Privy Council and the governing body of
the Fellowship on the other. The principal conditions
were that the Adventurers should carry on their entire
business within the Republic at the one Staple-town,
and all English subjects were forbidden to bring woollen
goods to any other port of the United Provinces. Their
later history is told in the lectures that precede. The
Staple and Court remained at Middelburg from 1598 to
1621; at Delft from 1621 to 1634; at Rotterdam from
1634 to 1656; at Dordrecht from 1656 to 1665. After
the close of the Second English War the States-General
in 1668 refused to grant the Adventurers their old
privileges, and the long connexion with the Netherlands
ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h3>E. <span class="smcap">The Interlopers.</span></h3>

<p>This name for the smugglers who, despite the exclusive
rights of the Merchant Adventurers, carried
English woollen goods to other Dutch ports than the
privileged Staple, was derived from the Dutch term
<i>inter-</i> or <i>entre-loopers</i>, i. e. 'runners-in'. During the
whole time that the Court and Staple were at Middelburg,
the port of Flushing, only a few miles distant on
the same island of Walcheren, was in English hands,
being one of the so-called 'cautionary' towns, which
were a pledge to Queen Elizabeth for the repayment
of her loans, and were garrisoned by English troops.
Flushing was during this period a centre of smuggling,
and the Flushing 'interlopers' a great annoyance to
the Adventurers. The smuggling went on, however,
with activity after the retrocession of Flushing in 1616,
especially to the port of Amsterdam. The powerful
Amsterdam merchants, who profited by the illicit trade,
did their utmost to encourage the 'interlopers', and to
protect them in spite of the angry protests of the
Adventurers, and of the corporations of the interested
Staple-towns.</p>

<p>The word 'interlopers' was soon universally applied
to all private traders who trespassed against the privileges
of a Chartered Company, more especially in the
East Indies.</p>


<h3>F. <span class="smcap">The English and Scottish Regiments in
the Dutch Service.</span></h3>

<p>Bodies of English volunteers were to be found
fighting under the Prince of Orange against the
Spaniards from the very beginning of the Dutch War
of Independence. In 1572 a force of 1,500 men under
Sir Humphrey Gilbert landed at Flushing, with the
connivance of Queen Elizabeth, and from this time
forward English troops took part in all the fiercest
fighting. In 1571 there were four English regiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
in the field, commanded by Colonels Norris, Cavendish,
Cotton, and Morgan. During the time of Leicester's
Governor-Generalship, 1585-7, the number of the
English army in the Netherlands amounted to 8,000
men, horse and foot. After his departure, a considerable
though reduced force was left under the
command of Lord Willoughby. In 1589 he was succeeded
in this post by the famous Sir Francis Vere,
the hero of the battle of Nieuport, 1600, and of the
siege of Ostend, 1601-4, and many another desperate
struggle. It was during the time of his command
that in 1595 an arrangement was made between the
States-General and Queen Elizabeth, by the terms of
which the English troops were henceforth to enter the
service of the States and receive Dutch pay. The
English Government allowed them to be recruited in
England, and they were to wear distinctive English
uniforms, carry English colours, and have their own
national march and beat of the drum, but were to take
during their service an oath of allegiance to the States-General
from whom the officers received their commissions.
The number was fixed at 4,000.</p>

<p>Sir Francis Vere was followed in the command by
his younger brother Sir Horace Vere, afterwards Lord
Vere of Tilbury, in 1608. During the twelve years'
truce, 1609-21, the English regiments were retained
in the service of the States, and in 1610 under
Sir Edward Cecil, afterwards Lord Wimbledon, distinguished
themselves at the siege of Jülich. From
the outbreak of the war again in 1621 to the peace of
Munster in 1648, the English regiments took part in
all the campaigns of Maurice (died 1625) and of
Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. In 1622 the
names of the four Colonels were Edward Vere, Edward
Cecil, Charles Morgan, and Edward Harwood. On
them and the Scottish Brigade always fell the brunt
of the fighting. They particularly distinguished themselves

the capture of Hertogenbosch (1622), of Maestricht
(1632), and of Breda (1637). In 1626, the army of
Frederick Henry included 14,500 English troops and
5,000 Scottish. At Hertogenbosch, Colonel Sir Edward
Vere was killed; at Maestricht, Colonel Sir Edward
Harwood and the Earl of Oxford; at Breda, Colonels
Sir Charles Morgan and Goring were wounded. In
1644, the names of the four Colonels were Craven,
Cromwell, Herbert, and Goring.</p>

<p>After the peace of Munster (1648), followed in 1650
by the death of the Stadholder William II, the republican
party in the States, now predominant, resolved to
reduce the number of their standing army, but the
English regiments were retained until the outbreak of
the war with the Commonwealth, when they were all disbanded.
In 1656, however, when peace had been restored,
a single regiment was recruited from the veterans, who
had remained in Holland, chiefly royalist refugees, and
it was henceforth known as the Holland regiment.
The command was conferred on Colonel John Cromwell,
a cousin of the Protector, but a stanch loyalist.</p>

<p>On the declaration of war between England and the
United Provinces in 1665, the Holland regiment was
summoned home. It became the 4th Regiment of Foot,
but still retained its old name, the Holland Regiment,
until 1689. In that year William III changed its
title to 'Prince George of Denmark's Regiment', and
it became the 3rd Foot. On the death of Prince
George in 1708, their style was once more altered,
and this time, from the colour of their waistcoats,
breeches, and stockings, they were styled 'the Buffs,'
a name they were to retain until our own day. They
are now the East Kent Regiment.</p>

<p>Not less interesting, and even more prolonged, is the
story of the Scottish regiments in the Netherlands.
The first record of Scottish volunteers is in 1573.
From 1603 to 1628 there were two regiments. After
1628 there were three, except during the reign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
William III, when their number was increased. The
group of regiments was always known as the Scots
Brigade, and it was continuously in the Dutch service
receiving Dutch pay for more than two centuries,
except the decade 1688-98, when, under the Dutch
King of Great Britain, they received British pay.
Even during the Anglo-Dutch wars of 1653, 1665,
and 1672 they were not disbanded, but were converted
for the time into Dutch regiments, and in consequence
of this their composition during this period became
considerably leavened with an admixture of foreigners.
Of the Scots who remained, it must always be remembered
that a number of them had been settled in the
Netherlands for two or three generations. After 1674
their thoroughly Scottish character was restored. From
that date until 1781 the Scots Brigade remained in
Holland. But when Great Britain declared war against
the United Provinces in that year, the question of the
position of the Scottish regiments was raised, and the
States-General resolved that they should be completely
denationalized and the officers be required to take an
oath abjuring allegiance to their own country. The
large majority at once threw up their commissions,
and the Scots Brigade in the Dutch service ceased to
exist. The subsequent history is curious. In 1794
the Scots Brigade was by order of the British
Government reformed. In 1803 its strength was
reduced, and the 'Brigade' became the 94th Regiment.
Until 1809 the 94th wore Highland dress, but this
was then discontinued. The regiment, however,
retained the green facings which they had inherited
from one of the Dutch regiments. Disbanded in 1818,
but reconstituted in 1878, the facings remained green,
and a diced band round the shako still proclaimed the
Scottish connexion. Its last service as the 94th was
in the Boer War of 1880, when a part of the regiment
when on march in time of peace was suddenly attacked
at Bronker's Spruit, and had heavy losses. The army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
reorganization of 1881 led to the 94th becoming the
battalion linked to the 88th, an Irish regiment, probably
for no other reason than the green facing. The
glorious Scottish tradition therefore of three centuries
was henceforth lost, and the regiment which represented
the Scots Brigade became the 2nd battalion
of the Connaught Rangers, with its head-quarters at
Galway.</p>

<h3>G. <span class="smcap">King Charles's Proclamation for the Restraint
of Fishing upon His Maiesties Seas and
Coasts without Licence (1636).</span></h3>

<p>Whereas our Father of blessed memory King
James did in the seuenth yeere of His reigne of
Great Brittaine, set forth a Proclamation touching
Fishing; whereby for the many important reasons
therein expressed, all persons of what Nation or
quality soeuer (being not His naturall borne Subjects)
were restrained from Fishing vpon any the Coasts
and Seas of Great Brittaine, Ireland and the rest of
the Isles adjacent, where most vsually heretofore
Fishing had been, vntill they had orderly demanded,
and obtained Licences from Our said Father or His
Commissioners in that behalfe, vpon paine of such
chastisement as should be fit to be inflicted vpon such
wilfull Offenders: Since which time, albeit neither
Our said Father, nor Our Selfe haue made any considerable
execution of the said Proclamation, but haue
with much patience expected a voluntary conformity
of Our Neighbours and Allies to so iust and reasonable
Prohibitions and Directions as are contained in the
same.</p>

<p>And now finding by experience, that all the inconueniences
which occasioned that Proclamation, are
rather increased than abated: We being very sensible
of the premisses, and well knowing how farre we are
obliged in Honour to maintaine the rights of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Crowne, especially of so great consequence, haue
thought it necessary, by the aduice of Our priuie
Councell, to renew the aforesaid restraint of Fishing
vpon Our aforesaid Coasts and Seas, without Licence
first obtained from Us, and by these presents to make
publique Declaration, that Our resolution is (at times
conuenient) to keepe such a competent strength of
Shipping vpon Our Seas, as may (by God's blessing)
be sufficient, both to hinder such further encroachments
vpon Our Regalities, and assist and protect
those Our good Friends and Allies, who shall henceforth,
by vertue of Our Licences (to be first obtained)
endeauour to take the benefit of Fishing vpon Our
Coasts and Seas, in the places accustomed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Giuen at Our Palace of Westminster the tenth day
of May, in the twelfth yeere of Our Reigne of England,
Scotland, France, and Ireland.</p>

<p class="center">
God saue the King.
